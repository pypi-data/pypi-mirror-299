We used the GloVe embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
and obtain a subset of embeddings based on the top ~200K words from Wikipedia for speeding up GloVe-related computations.
The terms list is provided as part of release, but the precomputed pkl dump can be made available upon request.
