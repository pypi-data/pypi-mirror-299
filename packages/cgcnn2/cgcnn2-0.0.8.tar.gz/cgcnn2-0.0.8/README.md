# CGCNN2

As the original Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) repository is no longer actively maintained, this repository is a reproduction of [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn) by Xie et al. It includes necessary updates for deprecated components and a few additional functions to ensure smooth operation. Despite its age, CGCNN remains a straightforward and fast deep learning framework that is easy to learn and use.

The package provides two major functions:

- **Training** a CGCNN model with a customized dataset.
- **Predicting** material properties with a pre-trained CGCNN model.
- **Fine-tuning** a pre-trained CGCNN model on a new dataset.

The original paper describes the details of the CGCNN framework:
