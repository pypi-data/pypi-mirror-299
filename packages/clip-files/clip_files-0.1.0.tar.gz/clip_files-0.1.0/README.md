Introducing `clip-files` - a simple yet useful command-line utility to gather files with a specific extension, format them with their full path, and copy their contents to your clipboard with a token count for GPT-4 usage!
Makes it simple to paste in your entire project into e.g., ChatGPT or Claude.ai, now that massive token limits are available.

## :star2: Features

* üìã Collect files with a specific extension and copy their formatted contents to your clipboard.
* üìÅ Prepend each file with `# File: full_path_here` for clarity.
* üßÆ Calculate and display the total number of tokens used, compatible with GPT-4 tokenization.
* üîÑ Easily handle and process multiple files in various directories.

## :books: Usage

To use `clip-files`, simply provide the directory to search and the file extension you want to collect:

```bash
clip-files --help
```
Shows the help message:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- clip-files --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
usage: clip-files [-h] [--initial-file INITIAL_FILE]
                  [--files FILES [FILES ...]]
                  [folder] [extension]

Collect files with a specific extension or specific files, format them for
clipboard, and count tokens.

positional arguments:
  folder                The folder to search for files.
  extension             The file extension to look for (e.g., .py, .txt).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --initial-file INITIAL_FILE
                        A file containing initial instructions to prepend to
                        the clipboard content. Default is an empty string.
  --files FILES [FILES ...]
                        Specific file paths to include (e.g., --files
                        path/to/file1.py path/to/file2.md). If not provided,
                        all files with the specified extension are included.
```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

`clip-files` will traverse the specified folder, gather files with the desired extension, format them with their paths, and copy the results to your clipboard along with the token count.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To install `clip-files`, use pip:

```bash
pip install clip-files
```

Alternatively, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basnijholt/clip-files.git
cd clip-files
pip install .
```

Or download the script directly:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basnijholt/clip-files/main/clip_files.py
```
and run it using:

```bash
python clip_files.py --help
```

## :bulb: Examples

* Collect all `.py` files in the `src` directory:

```
clip-files src .py
```

* Collect `.txt` files in `documents` and count tokens:

```
clip-files documents .txt
```

For more examples and detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation.

## :file_folder: Supported File Types

`clip-files` supports any file type as long as you provide the correct file extension. Common examples include:

- `.py` for Python files
- `.txt` for text files
- `.md` for Markdown files

## :1234: Token Counting

`clip-files` integrates with the `tiktoken` library to calculate tokens as they would be counted in GPT-4. This helps in understanding the cost and feasibility of processing the collected text with GPT-4 models.

The script will display the total token count after copying the formatted content to the clipboard.
