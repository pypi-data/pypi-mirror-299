nlpflow is a Python library designed to simplify the process of building and deploying natural language processing (NLP) applications. It leverages well-established tools like `spaCy`, `scikit-learn`, and `optuna` for text preprocessing and model development. nlpflow provides a powerful toolkit for automating NLP workflows, making it easier for data scientists and developers to efficiently build models.

## Features

Although nlpflow is in early-stage development, it already offers the following:

- A full text preprocessing pipeline with optional preprocessing steps.
- Development of Naive Bayes models with hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian optimization.

Planned features include:

- Tuning based on metrics beyond simple accuracy.
- Sentiment analysis using pretrained models.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using `spaCy`, with added functionality.
- Support for additional model types with hyperparameter tuning.
- Integration with popular tools such as MLFlow, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

## Installation

You can install nlpflow using pip:

```bash
pip install nlpflow
```

## Documentation
Documentation is still under development. For example usage of the library, check the [examples.ipynb](https://github.com/GiannopoulosK/nlpflow/blob/main/examples.ipynb) file.
