# code-payload

Condense and summarize a codebase for passing to an LLM as context.

## Features

- **Token-based Summarization**: Summarizes content based on token counts, making it suitable for language models.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Supports configuration through YAML files, environment variables, and CLI arguments.
- **Rich CLI Interface**: Use the CLI to interact with your projects, including rendering Jinja2 templates.
- **Customizable Templates**: Generate custom summaries or reports using Jinja2 templates.

## Installation

We recommend using `pipx` to make this globally available. Alternatively you can use `pip`.

```zsh
pipx install code-payload
```

## Usage

```zsh
code-payload --help
```

### Example Usage

To process a project directory and output a JSON summary:

```bash
code-payload /path/to/your/project
```

To override the file extensions to include:

```bash
code-payload /path/to/your/project --include-extensions .py,.js,.md
```

To use a custom template:

```bash
code-payload /path/to/your/project --render-args template_input=readme_summary.j2
```
