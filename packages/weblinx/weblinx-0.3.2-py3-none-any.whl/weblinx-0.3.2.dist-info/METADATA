## Intro

Welcome to `WebLINX`'s official repository! In addition to providing code used to train [the models](https://huggingface.co/collections/McGill-NLP/weblinx-models-65c57d4afeeb282d1dcf8434) reported in our [WebLINX paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05930), we also provide a comprehensive Python library (aka API) to help you work with the [WebLINX dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/McGill-NLP/WebLINX). 

If you want to get started with `weblinx`, please check out the following places:

# Install all dependencies
pip install weblinx[all]

# Install specific dependencies for...
# ...processing HTML 🖥️
pip install weblinx[processing]

# ...development of this library 🛠️
pip install weblinx[dev]
```

## Structure

This repository is structured in the following way:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `weblinx` | The `__init__.py` provides many useful abstractions to provide a Pythonic experience when working with the dataset. For example, you can use `weblinx.Demonstration` to manipulate a demonstration at a high-level, `weblinx.Replay` to focus on more finegrained details of the demonstration, including iterating over turns, or `weblinx.Turn` to focus on a specific turn. All relevant information is included in the documentations! |
| `weblinx.eval` | Code for evaluating action models trained with WebLINX, it has both `import`able functions/metrics, but can also be accessed via command line |
| `weblinx.processing` | Code for processing various inputs or outputs used by the models, it is extensively used in the models' processing code |
| `weblinx.utils` | Miscellaneous utility functions used across the codebase. |

## Modeling

Our `modeling/` repo-level directory has code for processing, training and evaluating the models reported in the paper (DMR, LLaMA, MindAct, Pix2Act, Flan-T5). It is separate from the `weblinx` library, which focuses on data processing and evaluation. You can use it by cloning this repository, and it is recommended to edit the files in `modeling/` directly for your own needs. Our modeling code is separate from the `weblinx` library, but requires it as a dependency. You can install the modeling code by running:

```bash
# First, install the base package
pip install weblinx

# Then, clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/McGill-NLP/weblinx
cd weblinx/modeling
```

For the rest of the instructions, please take a look at the [modeling README](./modeling/README.md).

## Evaluation

To install packages necessary for evaluation, run:

```bash
pip install weblinx[eval]
```

You can now access the evaluation module by importing in Python:

```python
import weblinx.eval
```

Use `weblinx.eval.metrics` for evaluation metrics, `weblinx.eval.__init__` for useful evaluation-related functions. You may also find it useful to take a look at `weblinx.processing.outputs` to get an idea of how to use the outputs of the model for evaluation.

To run the automatic evaluation, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m weblinx.eval --help
```

For more examples on how to use `weblinx.eval`, take a look at the [modeling README](./modeling/README.md).

> Note: We are still working on the code for `weblinx.eval` and `weblinx.processing.outputs`. If you have any questions or would like to contribute docs, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
