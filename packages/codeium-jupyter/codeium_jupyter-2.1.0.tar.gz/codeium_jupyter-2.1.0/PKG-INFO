## Installation

```bash
   pip install codeium-jupyter
```

## What is Codeium

[Codeium](https://www.codeium.com) is the modern coding superpower, a
**free** code acceleration toolkit built on cutting edge AI technology.
Currently, Codeium provides code completion tool in over 70+ languages,
with lightning fast speeds and state-of-the-art suggestion quality.

There are many parts of the modern coding workflow that are boring,
tedious, or frustrating, from regurgitating boilerplate to poring
through StackOverflow. Recent advances in AI allow us to eliminate these
parts, making it seamless to turn your ideas into code. With easy
integration into Visual Studio Code and a less than 2 minute
installation process, you can focus on being the best software
developer, not the best code monkey.

With Codeium, you get:

- Unlimited single and multi-line code completions forever
- Support for 70+ programming languages: Javascript, Python,
  Typescript, PHP, Go, Java, C, C++, Rust, Ruby, and more.

Join thousands of other developers who are using Codeium for free to
accelerate their software iteration process, improve their code quality
and consistency, reduce the number of code review iterations, accelerate
developer onboarding, and keep them in their flow state. Want to learn
more? Check out our [FAQ](https://www.codeium.com/faq).
