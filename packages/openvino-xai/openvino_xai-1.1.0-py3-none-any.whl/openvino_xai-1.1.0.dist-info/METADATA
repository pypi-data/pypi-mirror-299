![OpenVINO XAI Concept](docs/source/_static/ovxai-concept.svg)

**OpenVINO™ Explainable AI (XAI) Toolkit** provides a suite of XAI algorithms for visual explanation of
[**OpenVINO™**](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) as well as [**PyTorch**](https://pytorch.org) and [**ONNX**](https://onnx.ai/) models.

Given AI models and input images, **OpenVINO XAI** generates **saliency maps**
which highlights regions of the interest in the inputs from the models' perspective
to help users understand the reason why the complex AI models output such responses.

Using this package, you can augment the model analysis & explanation feature
on top of the existing OpenVINO inference pipeline with a few lines of code.

```python
import openvino_xai as xai

explainer = xai.Explainer(model=ov_model, task=xai.Task.CLASSIFICATION)

# Existing inference pipeline
for i, image in enumerate(images):
    labels = infer(model=ov_model, image=image)

    # Model analysis
    explanation = explainer(data=image, targets=labels)
    explanation.save(dir_path="./xai", name=str(i))
```

---

## Features

See more method comparison at the [User Guide](docs/source/user-guide.md).

### Supported explainable models

Most of CNNs and Transformer models from [Pytorch Image Models (timm)](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models) are supported and validated.

Please refer to the following known issues for unsupported models and reasons.

* [Runtime error from ONNX / OpenVINO IR models while conversion or inference for XAI (#29)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/issues/29)
* [Models not supported by white box XAI methods (#30)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_xai/issues/30)

> **_NOTE:_**  GenAI / LLMs would be also supported incrementally in the upcoming releases.

## Quick Start

### Hello, OpenVINO XAI

Let's imagine the case that our OpenVINO model is up and running on a inference pipeline.
While watching the outputs, we may want to analyze the model's behavior for debugging or understanding purposes.

By using the **OpenVINO XAI** `Explainer`, we can visualize why the model gives such responses.
In this example, we are trying to know the reason why the model outputs a `cheetah` label for the given input image.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import openvino as ov
import openvino_xai as xai

# Load the model: IR or ONNX
ov_model: ov.Model = ov.Core().read_model("mobilenet_v3.xml")

# Load the image to be analyzed
image: np.ndarray = cv2.imread("tests/assets/cheetah_person.jpg")
image = cv2.resize(image, dsize=(224, 224))
image = np.expand_dims(image, 0)

# Create the Explainer for the model
explainer = xai.Explainer(
    model=ov_model,  # accepts path arguments "mobilenet_v3.xml" or "mobilenet_v3.onnx" as well
    task=xai.Task.CLASSIFICATION,
)

# Generate saliency map for the label of interest
explanation: xai.Explanation = explainer(
    data=image,
    targets=293,  # (cheetah), accepts label indices or actual label names if label_names provided
    overlay=True,  # saliency map overlay over the input image, defaults to False
)

# Save saliency maps to output directory
explanation.save(dir_path="./output")
```

Original image | Explained image
---------------|----------------
![Oringinal images](tests/assets/cheetah_person.jpg) | ![Explained image](docs/source/_static/xai-cheetah.png)

We can see that model is focusing on the body or skin area of the animals to tell if this image contains actual cheetahs.

### Insert XAI head to your models

Using the `insert_xai` API, we can insert XAI head to existing OpenVINO or PyTorch models directly and get additional "saliency_map" output in the same inference pipeline.

```python
import torch
import timm

# Get a PyTorch model from TIMM
torch_model: torch.nn.Module = timm.create_model("resnet18.a1_in1k", in_chans=3, pretrained=True)

# Insert XAI head
model_xai: torch.nn.Module = xai.insert_xai(torch_model, xai.Task.CLASSIFICATION)

# Torch XAI model inference
model_xai.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model_xai(torch.from_numpy(image_norm))
    logits = outputs["prediction"]  # BxC
    saliency_maps = outputs["saliency_map"]  # BxCxHxW: per-class saliency map
```

### More advanced use-cases

Users could tweak the basic use-case according to their purpose, which include but not limited to:

* Select XAI mode (White-Box or Black-Box) or even specific method which are automatically decided by default
* Provide custom model pre/post processing functions like resize and normalizations which the model expects
* Customize output image visualization options
* Explain multiple class targets, passing them as label indices or as actual label names
* Call explainer multiple times to explain multiple images or to use different targets
* Insert XAI head to your PyTorch models and export to ONNX format to generate saliency maps on ONNX Runtime
  (Refer to the [full example script](./examples/run_torch_onnx.py))

Please find more options and scenarios in the following links:

### Playing with the examples

Please look around the runnable [example scripts](./examples) and play with them to get used to the `Explainer` and `insert_xai` APIs.

```bash
# Prepare models by running tests (need "pip install openvino_xai[dev]" extra option)
# Models are downloaded and stored in .data/otx_models
pytest tests/test_classification.py

# Run a bunch of classification examples
# All outputs will be stored in the corresponding output directory
python examples/run_classification.py .data/otx_models/mlc_mobilenetv3_large_voc.xml \
tests/assets/cheetah_person.jpg --output output
