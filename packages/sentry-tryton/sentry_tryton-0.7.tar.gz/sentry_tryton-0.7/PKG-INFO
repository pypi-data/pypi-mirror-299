Sentry-Tryton
=============

Sentry integration for the Tryton application framework.

This module creates a new LoggingHandler for registering tryton exceptions on
sentry. This exception will get some information available on tryton:

* Info about the current user
* The list of modules activated and it's verions.
* The database name
* The backend name
* The request context

It also allows to define a custom error message and description that will be
sent to the user instead of showing the full traceback.

Usage
-----

The trytond-logconf.cfg provides an example config file for using this handler.
You only have to specify your sentry dsn on the first arg of the sentry
handler. Once you have modified this file just lunch your trytond with::

    trytond --logconf trytond-logconf.cfg
