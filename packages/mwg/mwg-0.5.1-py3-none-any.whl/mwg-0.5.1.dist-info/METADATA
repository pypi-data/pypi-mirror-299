# markov-word-generator
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/markov-word-generator.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/markov-word-generator) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)`

Markov-Word-Generator is a Python library for generating random, credible, and plausible words based on a list of words. It estimates the probability of the next character in a word based on the frequency of the previous N characters, using Markov chains.
This uses [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)


# Installation
```bash
pip install markov-word-generator
```

# Principle

To generate random words that sound like real words, this library analyzes character distribution among a corpus in a given language. It creates a mapping table for character combinations and their associated frequency in the corpus. By estimating the probability of a character based on the previous characters, the library generates words that mimic real language patterns.

Here are heatmaps showing the distribution of each character (column) given the previous one (row).
- `$` = End of word
- `^` = Start of a word

In English:

![English character distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/markov-word-generator/main/images/heatmap_EN-words.png)

And in French:

![French character distribution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggouzi/markov-word-generator/main/images/heatmap_FR-words.png)

Estimating the probability of a character to appear given the probability of the given previous one works fine but is still hazardous. We can increase the likelihood of the world sounds true by looking at the next N previous characters.

The generator will parse an input text file containing one word per line (dictionary), count each character occurrence based on the occurrence of the N previous ones  create a mapping table for each character-combination and its associated frequency in the corpus.

# Usage

To generate a random word in English by predicting the probability of each new character based on the last 4 characters, you can use the following code:

```python
from markov_word_generator import MarkovWordGenerator, WordType

# Generate a random word in English by predicting the probability of each new character based on its last 4 last characters
generator = MarkovWordGenerator(
	markov_length=4,
	language='en',
	word_type=WordType.WORD,
)
print(generator.generate_word())
```
output:
```
rebutaneously
```



## Parameters

- MarkovWordGenerator():
	- `markov_length`: (int): The number of previous characters to consider.
	- `language`: (str): The language to use for word generation. **Must be part of the supported languages**.
	- `word_type`:  (str): The type of word to generate. **Must be part of the supported word types**.
  - `dictionary_filename`: (str): The corpus to parse for character frequency analysis. **Must be used only if `language` and `word_type` are not set**.
  - `ignore_accents`:  (bool): If set to *True*, accents are ignored during parsing. Default to *False*

- generate_word()
  - seed: (str): Seed to generate a word starting with the given seed. Default to empty

```python
from markov_word_generator import MarkovWordGenerator, WordType, AllowedLanguages

# Generate a random German name by predicting the probability of each new character based on its last 3 last characters
generator = MarkovWordGenerator(
	markov_length=3,
	language=AllowedLanguages.DE,
	word_type=WordType.NAME,
)
print(generator.generate_word())
```
```
ludgerten
```

## Supported languages and word_types

You can access the list of supported languages and word types using the following functions:

```python
import markov_word_generator

# List supported languages
print(markov_word_generator.get_supported_languages())
# ['EN', 'FR', 'DE', 'FI', 'IT', 'PT', 'SE']

# List supported word_type
print(markov_word_generator.get_supported_word_types())
# ['WORD', 'NAME']

```

More languages and word types (plants, movie names, cities...) can be added in the future.


## Impact of the markov_length parameter

- The higher the number of characters N we take into account, the more credible the word will be. We may end up with already existing words (see [Impact of the markov_length parameter](#impact-of-the-markov_length-parameter) below).
- Lowering N will lead to words that sound less real. Some words will also either very short (1-2 chars) or very long (>20chars)

```python
from markov_word_generator import MarkovWordGenerator, WordType, AllowedLanguages

generator = MarkovWordGenerator(
	markov_length=N, # N=1,2,3,4 or 5 in following examples
	language=AllowedLanguages.EN,
	word_type=WordType.WORD
)

for i in range(0, 10):
    print(generator.generate_word())
```

# Benchmarks
Empirically generating 5000 random words for each of the tests and checking the percentage of them which do exist as actual valid words.
10 tests have been running. From N=1 to N=5 in both English and French languages
Results are the following

| N\Language | EN | FR* |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | 4.61% | 6.15%
| 2 | 8.89% | 10.60%
| 3 | 14.80% | 10.04%
| 4 | 33.08% | 33.88%
| 5 | 62.84% | 65.68%

*Empirical measurements of the percentage of output words from the generator that are real words (exists in the dictionary) based on the number of characters N we take into account in the markov_chain*
over 5000 samples
**accents have been ignored in benchmarks in French*

From N=5, there are more than 50% of chances to generate an existing word.

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
