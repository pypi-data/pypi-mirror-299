- **Pattern Generation**: Create and display various patterns easily.
    - ***Right-angle triangle***
    - ***Inverse Right-angle triangle***
    - ***Pascal's Triangle***
    - ***Hollow Square***
    - ***Hollow Triangle***
    - ***Inverse Pyramid***
    - ***Pyramid***
    - ***Diamond***
    - ***Square***
- **Fibonacci Series**: Generate Fibonacci numbers with minimal effort.
- **Check Palindrome**: Easily check if a given string is a palindrome.
