**Library for data retrieval and processing of NASA GSFC Snow Water Equivalent Synthetic Aperture Radar and Radiometer data.**

swesarr_pytool is a python library for data retrieval and processing of NASA GSFC Snow Water Equivalent Synthetic Aperture Radar and Radiometer data.

The Snow Water Equivalent Synthetic Aperture Radar and Radiometer (SWESARR) is a Tri-Frequency Radar and Radiometer
instrument designed to measure the water content in a snowpack. The instrument, developed at NASAâ€™s Goddard Space Flight
Center, uses active and passive microwave sensors to map the radio frequency emissions of the snowpack, which can then be turned into a measurement of
snow water equivalent.

SWESARR has three active (including a dual Ku band) and three passive bands. Radar data is collected in dual polarization
(VV, VH) while the radiometer makes single polarization (H) observations.
