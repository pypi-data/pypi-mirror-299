## Typing stubs for qrcode

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`qrcode`](https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`qrcode`.

This version of `types-qrcode` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `qrcode==8.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/qrcode. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`d16fe74e1f7a56ae05dfaa2fad595d5184c574d6`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/d16fe74e1f7a56ae05dfaa2fad595d5184c574d6) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.383, and
pytype 2024.9.13.
