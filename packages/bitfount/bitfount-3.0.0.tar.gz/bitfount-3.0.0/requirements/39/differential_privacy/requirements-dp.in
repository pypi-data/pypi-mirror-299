opacus>=1,<1.2  # used for Differential Privacy in PyTorch;
pytorch-lightning<1.7,!=1.6.4,!=1.6.5  # minimum torch version changed in 1.7, unnecessary protobuf constraint in 1.6.4 and 1.6.5
smartnoise-sql>=0.2.3,<1  # used for private SQL algorithms (import snsql); <1 as incompatible sqlalchemy constraint
torch==1.8.1  # pinned version to be compatible with torchcsprng, which is needed by opacus; opacus itself needs >=1.8
torchcsprng>=0.2.1  # cryptographically secure pseudo-RNG; used for opacus
torchvision==0.9.1  # used for image processing
