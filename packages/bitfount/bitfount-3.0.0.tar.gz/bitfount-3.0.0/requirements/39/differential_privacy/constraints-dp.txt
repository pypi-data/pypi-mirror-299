# This file contains pip package version upper constraints for our DP dependencies
# due to breaking or compatibility changes in versions beyond the constraint.
# This file should be reviewed and updated regularly and our code fixed appropriately
# (if necessary) so that we can keep up with the latest versions of our dependencies.
#
# This file must use the < or <= operators to specify upper version constraints. This
# file must not contain lower version constraints (e.g. >= or >).
