    The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any existing row with
    the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to `false`), the existing row is
    completely replaced by the new row. When set to `true`, the new row is
    deep-merged into the existing row

    For example, say there is an existing row in the DB
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as
    `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row
    will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the
    new row as `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`

    """Use the `_parent_id` field to create this row as a subspan of an existing row.

    It cannot be specified alongside `_is_merge=true`. Tracking hierarchical
    relationships are important for tracing (see the
    [guide](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing) for full details).

    For example, say we have logged a row
    `{"id": "abc", "input": "foo", "output": "bar", "expected": "boo", "scores": {"correctness": 0.33}}`.
    We can create a sub-span of the parent row by logging
    `{"_parent_id": "abc", "id": "llm_call", "input": {"prompt": "What comes after foo?"}, "output": "bar", "metrics": {"tokens": 1}}`.
    In the webapp, only the root span row `"abc"` will show up in the summary view.
    You can view the full trace hierarchy (in this case, the `"llm_call"` row) by
    clicking on the "abc" row.
