    The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any existing row with
    the same id in the DB. By default (or when set to `false`), the existing row is
    completely replaced by the new row. When set to `true`, the new row is
    deep-merged into the existing row

    For example, say there is an existing row in the DB
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as
    `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row
    will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the
    new row as `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row will be
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`

    It cannot be specified alongside `_is_merge=true`. Tracking hierarchical
    relationships are important for tracing (see the
    [guide](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/guides/tracing) for full details).

    For example, say we have logged a row
    `{"id": "abc", "input": "foo", "output": "bar", "expected": "boo", "scores": {"correctness": 0.33}}`.
    We can create a sub-span of the parent row by logging
    `{"_parent_id": "abc", "id": "llm_call", "input": {"prompt": "What comes after foo?"}, "output": "bar", "metrics": {"tokens": 1}}`.
    In the webapp, only the root span row `"abc"` will show up in the summary view.
    You can view the full trace hierarchy (in this case, the `"llm_call"` row) by
    clicking on the "abc" row.

    Context is additional information about the code that produced the experiment

    The ground truth value (an arbitrary, JSON serializable object) that you'd
    compare to `output` to determine if your `output` value is correct or not.
    Braintrust currently does not compare `output` to `expected` for you, since
    there are so many different ways to do that correctly. Instead, these values are
    just used to help you navigate your experiments while digging into analyses.
    However, we may later use these values to re-score outputs or fine-tune your
    models
    """

    input: Optional[object]
    """
    The arguments that uniquely define a test case (an arbitrary, JSON serializable
    object). Later on, Braintrust will use the `input` to know whether two test
    cases are the same between experiments, so they should not contain
    experiment-specific state. A simple rule of thumb is that if you run the same
    experiment twice, the `input` should be identical
    """

    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Optional[object]]]
    """
    A dictionary with additional data about the test example, model outputs, or just
    about anything else that's relevant, that you can use to help find and analyze
    examples later. For example, you could log the `prompt`, example's `id`, or
    anything else that would be useful to slice/dice later. The values in `metadata`
    can be any JSON-serializable type, but its keys must be strings
    """

    metrics: Optional[Metrics]

    Metrics are numerical measurements tracking the execution of the code that

    output: Optional[object]
    """
    The output of your application, including post-processing (an arbitrary, JSON
    serializable object), that allows you to determine whether the result is correct
    or not. For example, in an app that generates SQL queries, the `output` should
    be the _result_ of the SQL query generated by the model, not the query itself,
    because there may be multiple valid queries that answer a single question
    """

    scores: Optional[Dict[str, Optional[float]]]
    """A dictionary of numeric values (between 0 and 1) to log.

    The scores should give you a variety of signals that help you determine how
    accurate the outputs are compared to what you expect and diagnose failures. For
    example, a summarization app might have one score that tells you how accurate
    the summary is, and another that measures the word similarity between the
    generated and grouth truth summary. The word similarity score could help you
    determine whether the summarization was covering similar concepts or not. You
    can use these scores to help you sort, filter, and compare experiments
