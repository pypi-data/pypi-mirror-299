    The `_is_merge` field controls how the row is merged with any existing row with

    completely replaced by the new row. When set to `true`, the new row is
    deep-merged into the existing row

    For example, say there is an existing row in the DB
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 10}}`. If we merge a new row as
    `{"_is_merge": true, "id": "foo", "input": {"b": 11, "c": 20}}`, the new row
    will be `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": 5, "b": 11, "c": 20}}`. If we replace the

    It can only be specified alongside `_is_merge=true`. `_merge_paths` is a list of
    paths, where each path is a list of field names. The deep merge will not descend
    below any of the specified merge paths.

    For example, say there is an existing row in the DB
    `{"id": "foo", "input": {"a": {"b": 10}, "c": {"d": 20}}, "output": {"a": 20}}`.
