# Here lies the default settings for battery-advisor.
# You can change these settings by copying this file to ~/.config/battery-advisor/settings.toml
# and modifying the values there.

# These are the tresholds where battery-advisor will alert different battery statuses.
# The values are in percentage. Ex. 15%, 10%, 5%.
# The values must be in descending order.
# At battery action, the configured action will execute after 3 seconds of the notification.

# This is the action that will be executed when the battery reaches the battery_action_treshold.
battery_action = "hibernate"

# How many seconds to check between battery status.

# Note, if you close the notification, the first action will be executed.
# Remind is only supported for low battery.

# By default, it will remind in 3 minutes.

# Here you can define the available actions for the battery-advisor.
# The commands must be separated in lists as Python's subprocess library arguments.

# As you can see `remind` is not defined here as the remind me later feature
# is done programatically and not with the terminal.

# You can still use it on the low and critical options settings.
