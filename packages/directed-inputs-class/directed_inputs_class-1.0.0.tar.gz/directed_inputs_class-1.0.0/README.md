Directed Inputs Class is a Python library that provides a flexible and robust interface for managing inputs from various sources such as environment variables, stdin, and predefined dictionaries. It offers features like input freezing, thawing, and advanced decoding utilities.

## Key Features

- üß© **Environment Variable Integration** - Seamlessly integrates environment variables into your inputs.
- üì• **Stdin Input Handling** - Read and merge inputs from stdin with optional overrides.
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Input Freezing and Thawing** - Freeze inputs to prevent modifications, and thaw them when needed.
- üîÑ **Advanced Decoding Utilities** - Decode inputs from Base64, JSON, and YAML formats with error handling.
- üîß **Type Conversion** - Convert inputs to boolean or integer types with robust error handling.

### Example Usage

```python
from directed_inputs_class import DirectedInputsClass

# Initialize with environment variables and stdin
dic = DirectedInputsClass(from_environment=True, from_stdin=True)

# Retrieve and decode an input
decoded_value = dic.decode_input("example_key", decode_from_base64=True)
print(decoded_value)
```

### Freezing and Thawing Inputs

```python
from directed_inputs_class import DirectedInputsClass

# Initialize with some inputs
dic = DirectedInputsClass(inputs={"key1": "value1"})

# Freeze the inputs
frozen_inputs = dic.freeze_inputs()
print(frozen_inputs)  # Outputs: {'key1': 'value1'}

# Thaw the inputs
thawed_inputs = dic.thaw_inputs()
print(thawed_inputs)  # Outputs: {'key1': 'value1'}
```
