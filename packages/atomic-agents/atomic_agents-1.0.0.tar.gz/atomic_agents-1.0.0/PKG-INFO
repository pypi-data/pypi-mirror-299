# Atomic Agents

A versatile framework designed to facilitate the creation and management of intelligent agents, with an optional CLI tool.

## Installation

You can install Atomic Agents with different options:

- Full installation (framework + CLI):
  ```bash
  pip install atomic-agents
  ```

- Core framework only:
  ```bash
  pip install atomic-agents[core]
  ```

- CLI tool only:
  ```bash
  pip install atomic-agents[cli]
  ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later

### Installation

1. Either install the Atomic Agents package through pip, or locally from source:
   ```bash
   pip install atomic-agents
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   cd atomic-agents
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Install the Atomic Assembler CLI. This is optional, but it provides a convenient way to grab new Atomic Tools from the [Atomic Forge](atomic-forge):
