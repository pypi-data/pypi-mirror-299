# PyBell

PyBell is a multi service notification system written in Python.

The purpose behind this utility is to support sending push messages from a shell program
to indicate success or failure of an event to one or more notification systems.

For example if a Backup fails a push message can be sent to indicate failure.

The logic behind PyBell is that multiple services can be configured and whilst individual 
services can be selected by default the list of services will be chosen on a first work basis allowing 
for fallback to secondary services if the first etc do not work.

Because of the nature of this whilst the configuration file holds the connection details the command line
is very simple allowing for a message title, message and a priority to be used where supported.

PyBell currently supports the following services for basic message sending, this is easy to extend.

* Apprise
* Gotify
* PushBullet
* PushOver
* Telegram

For details of the required configuration once installed issue pybell -ch

## Apprise

Apprise is a sender of senders where other services can be configured and it will forward on.

It seems to lack the ability to send to 1 and if that fails then send to 2nd etc hence the evolution of this 
utility.

Priorities are not supported by the API of Apprise, but it can use priorities to forwarded services.

## Gotify

This is a self hosted solution allowing for messages to be sent from inside an environment without 
internet access

Priorities are available with this service, by default a priority of 6 is sent.

## PushBullet

An internet hosted platform supporting multiple facilities. 
This utility simply sends a broadcast push to all devices
I did look at using channels but these did not offer privacy at the time of writing so I did not explore
any further.

Priorities are not supported with this service.

## PushOver

An internet hosted platform dedicated to Push notifications.

Prioritoes are supported with this services, by default a priority of 0 is sent

## Telegram

An internet hosted chat service.
This utility can post to any chat which can be a dedicated 1-1 chat or a channel depending on the
chat identities supplied.

Priorities are not supported with this service.

## Example

pybell -t Test Message -m Hello World

This will send a notification with title of Test Message and message body of Hello World to the 1st defined 
entry in the pybell configuration file.

pybell -n ntfy -t Test Message -m Hello World

Will do the same as the previous example but just send to the config entry defined as ntfy
