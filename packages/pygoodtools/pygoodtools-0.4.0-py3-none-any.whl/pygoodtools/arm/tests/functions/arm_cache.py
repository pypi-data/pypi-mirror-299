    Decorator to implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.
    Args:
        maxsize (int, optional): The maximum size of the cache. Defaults to 128.
    Returns:
        function: A decorator that wraps a function with LRU caching.
    The LRU cache stores the results of function calls and reuses them when the same inputs occur again, 
    up to a maximum number of cached items specified by `maxsize`. When the cache exceeds `maxsize`, 
    the least recently used items are discarded to make room for new ones.
    Example:
        @lru_cache(maxsize=100)
        def expensive_function(x, y):
            # Expensive computation here
        # The first call will compute the result
        result1 = expensive_function(1, 2)
        # The second call with the same arguments will return the cached result
        result2 = expensive_function(1, 2)
