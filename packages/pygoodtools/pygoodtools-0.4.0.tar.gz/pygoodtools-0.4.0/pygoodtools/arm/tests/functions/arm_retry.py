    A decorator that retries a function execution a specified number of times with a delay between attempts.

    Args:
        retries (int): The number of times to retry the function. Default is 3.
        delay (int): The delay in seconds between each retry attempt. Default is 1.

    Returns:
        function: A wrapped function that will be retried upon failure.

    Raises:
        Exception: The last exception encountered after all retry attempts have been exhausted.

    Example:
        @retry(retries=5, delay=2)
        def unstable_function():
            # Function implementation that might fail
            pass
