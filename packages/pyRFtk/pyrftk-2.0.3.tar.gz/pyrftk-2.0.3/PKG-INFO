## About

pyRFtk is a Python library able to build and analyse RF circuits, originally designed for ICRH antennae but now widely deployable.
you can:
- Incorporate touchstone files to create your own elements
- See the maximum current throughout your circuit
- Compute the S-matrix
- Detect Arcs
- Deembed systems
- ...

## Authors
The code was developed by RF-engineer Frederic Durodie and later
on refactored, packaged and documented by Arthur Adriaens
