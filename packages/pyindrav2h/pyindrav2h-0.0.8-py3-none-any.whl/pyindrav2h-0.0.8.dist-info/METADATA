# pyindrav2h

A basic API client and example CLI to interact with Indra V2H Chargers.  Required by Home Assistant.

This is a very early Alpha release, and functionality may change very rapidly.

NOTE: Indra Renewable Technologies Limited are aware of this integration.  However, this is an unofficial integration and Indra are not able to provide support for direct API integrations.  The Indra API will likely change in future which may result in functionality provided by this integration failing at any time.



## Installation

Install pyindrav2h with pip.  Using venv is recommended.

```bash
  pip install pyindrav2h
```
to update pyindrav2h
```bash
  pip install pyindrav2h -U
```
On installation a CLI will become available: ```indracli```
## Usage/Examples

usage: indracli [-h] [-u EMAIL] [-p PASSWORD] [-d] {statistics,device,alldevices,all,loadmatch,idle,exportmatch,charge,discharge,schedule} ...
