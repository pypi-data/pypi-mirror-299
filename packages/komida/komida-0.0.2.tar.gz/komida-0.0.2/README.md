# Komida API (komida)

Returns structured data from the [komida calendar][calendar].

## Getting Started

Start by installing the dependencies using pip.
One way of doing this is `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
This will install **all** dependencies, including those used for development.
To only install the minimum set of requirements and the package use `pip install -e .`.

You can also install the latest release with `pip install kapi`.

## Improvements

- Sanitize the data
- Fix allergens
