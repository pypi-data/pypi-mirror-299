## Typing stubs for m3u8

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`m3u8`](https://github.com/globocom/m3u8) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`m3u8`.

This version of `types-m3u8` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `m3u8==6.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/m3u8. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
