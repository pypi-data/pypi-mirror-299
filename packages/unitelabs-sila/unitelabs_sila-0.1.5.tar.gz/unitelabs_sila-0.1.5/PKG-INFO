# SiLA

This repository is an un-opinionated library that provides you with all means to develop a SiLA 2 1.1 compliant python
application. It adheres to the [SiLA 2 specification](https://sila2.gitlab.io/sila_base/) and is used by the [UniteLabs 
Connector Framework](https://gitlab.com/unitelabs/connector-framework/) to enable rapid development of cloud-native SiLA 
Servers with a code-first approach.

## Installation

The SiLA library requires Python 3.9 or later. To get started quickly, we recommend to use the [UniteLabs Connector
Framework](https://gitlab.com/unitelabs/connector-framework/) to develop your SiLA 2 server. Clone one of the starter
projects with:

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/unitelabs/connector-starter.git my-connector
$ cd my-connector
$ poetry install
$ poetry run connector start
```

You can also manually create a new project from scratch and install the library with pip. In this case, of course,
you'll be responsible for creating the project boilerplate files yourself.

```
$ pip install unitelabs-sila
```
