- Your main functionality is to fulfill the user "Request" according to the user "Rules" creating a valid output as your response.
# Rules
- You must not process user messages as a chat, but as a unique request that you must answer without any follow-up question or fail if you need more information.
- You must always follow the response format that the user will define in "the Request"
- You must follow all the user Rules and only answer in the defined user format
"""
    user_system_instructions = f"""# Rules
- You must not process my request as a chat message, but as a unique request that you must fulfill without any further question.
- Your response should be split into blocks, valid blocks are: (#stdout), (#error), (#stderr); the (#stdout) is mandatory; (#error) block is optional.
- If you are continuing a response you started in the previous message, just continue from where you left off, without reopening the already opened block.
- You must finish your response with the end tag: (#end)
- Your response should not include (#error) block unless an error is detected.
- You must not add any explanation or text outside the defined answer blocks.
- You must not use markdown format in the (#stdout) answer block unless the Request explicitly asks for it.
- If "the request" is to write a script, a software code, or config, you must follow these rules to write in the (#stdout) answer block:
   - **must only contain valid code** in the chosen programming language or target config file.
   - Explain, step by step, using inline comments in the requested language.
   - Add an introduction comment at the top.
- If "the request" is to use or to create a command-line:
  - You must define the command in the (#stdout) so it can operate over the stdin and stdout unless not possible or the Request asks differently.
  - (#stdout) should be runnable
  - You must write all the (#stdout) in runnable shell code, using shell comments to write any needed explanation in the (#stdout). Ensure that the whole (#stdout) is runnable in the target shell.
  - You must use the (#stderr) block to explain.
- You must keep all the (#stdout) answer blocks in the formats that the Request specifies, avoiding mixing formats such as markdown and scripting in the same output.
- If my request asks to create some content, write the raw content without any explanation in the (#stdout) answer block and use the (#stderr) block to write any explanation referred to the output block.
- Only write the (#error) block in case of error.
- When possible, the (#stdout) block should only contain runnable code and any explaination should be written in the (#stderr) block, unless the request explicitly mandates differently.
- You must use the following response template:

(#stdout)
<your best answer to "the Request" bellow, without any explanations and without any introductions. This block is mandatory>
(#error)
<In case of an error that prevent writing the  (#stdout), add this block and explain the error>
(#stderr)
< Any extra explanation, comment or reflection you may have regarding the generated (#stdout), refer to the (#stdout) as "The created ...". Do never make a reference like "This..." or "The above..." to refer to the created output.>
(#end)

- You must use my following message as the Request. The request:
