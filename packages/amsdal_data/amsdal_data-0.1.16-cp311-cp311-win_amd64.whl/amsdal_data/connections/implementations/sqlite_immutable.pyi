    Manages an immutable connection to an SQLite database with historical data support.

    This class provides methods to connect to an SQLite database, execute queries, manage transactions,
    and handle historical data. It extends the functionality of `SqlHistoryConnectionMixin` and
    `HistoricalConnectionBase` to support immutable data operations.

    Attributes:
        TABLE_SEPARATOR (str): The separator used for table names.
        COLUMN_SEPARATOR (str): The separator used for column names.
