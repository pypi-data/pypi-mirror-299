class Transcribe:
    """
    Manages transcription services provided by the Vulavula API. This class is designed to handle
    the conversion of speech to text, enabling users to transcribe audio files efficiently.

    The Transcribe class supports operations like uploading audio files for transcription and retrieving
    transcribed text.

    Parameters:
        client_token (str): The API token required for authenticating all requests.
        base_url (str): The base URL for the API endpoints.
        session (requests.Session): The session used for HTTP requests to optimize connection reuse.

    Example:
         transcribe_client = Transcribe("your_api_token", "https://beta-vulavula-services.lelapa.ai/api/v1/")
         transcription_result = transcribe_client.transcribe("path/to/audio/file.mp3")
