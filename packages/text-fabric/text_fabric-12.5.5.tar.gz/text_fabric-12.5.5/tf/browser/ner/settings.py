This is not a hard limit. We only use it if the page contains the whole corpus or
a filtered subset of it.

But as soon we have selected a token string or an entity, we show all buckets
that contain it, no matter how many there are.

!!! note "Performance"
    We use the
    [CSS device *content-visibility*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility)
    to restrict rendering to the material that is visible in the viewport. However,
    this is not supported in Safari, so the performance may suffer in Safari if we load
    the whole corpus on a single page.

    In practice, even in browsers that support this device are not happy with a big
    chunk of HTML on the page, since they do have to build a large DOM, including
    event listeners.

    That's why we restrict the page to a limited amount of buckets.

    But when a selection has been made, it is more important to show the whole,
    untruncated result set, than to incur a performance penalty.
    Moreover, it is hardly the case that a selected entity of occurrence occurs in a
    very large number of buckets.

"""CSS style configuration for entity features.

Here we define properties of the styling of the entity features and their
values.
Since these features are defined in configuration, we cannot work with a fixed
style sheet.

We divide entity features in *keyword* features and *free* features.
The typical keyword feature is `kind`, it has a limited set of values.
The typical free feature is `eid`, it has an unbounded number of values.

As it is now, we could have expressed this in a fixed style sheet.
But if we open up to allowing for more entity features, we can use this setup
to easily configure the formatting of them.

However, we should move these definitions to the `ner.yaml` file then, so that the
only place of configuration is that YAML file, and not this file.
