Fast Sentence Embeddings
==================================

Fast Sentence Embeddings is a Python library that serves as an addition to Gensim. This library is intended to compute *sentence vectors* for large collections of sentences or documents with as little hassle as possible:

```

from marcel_fse.models.view import get_sentence_scores

import pandas as pd
import gensim.downloader as api
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

df= pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\Marcel Tino\Desktop\economy.xlsx')

df=df[['Quote']]

model_name="word2vec-google-news-300"
custom_text="economy is good"

df,df1=get_sentence_scores(df,model_name,custom_text)

```
