PolarRoute is a long-distance maritime polar route planning package, able to take into account complex and changing environmental conditions. It allows the construction of optimised routes through three main stages: discrete modelling of the environmental conditions using a non-uniform mesh, the construction of mesh-optimal paths, and physics informed path smoothing. In order to account for different vehicle properties we construct a series of data-driven functions that can be applied to the environmental mesh to determine the speed limitations and fuel requirements for a given vessel and mesh cell. The environmental modelling component of this functionality is provided by the [MeshiPhi](https://github.com/antarctica/MeshiPhi) library.

## Installation

PolarRoute is available from PyPI and can be installed by running: 
```
pip install polar-route
```

Alternatively you can install PolarRoute by downloading the source code from GitHub:
```
git clone https://github.com/Antarctica/PolarRoute
pip install -e ./PolarRoute
```
Use of `-e` is optional, based on whether you want to be able to edit the installed copy of the package.

In order to run the test suite you will also need to include the `[test]` flag to install the optional test dependencies:

```
pip install -e ./PolarRoute[test]
```

> NOTE: Some features of the PolarRoute package require GDAL to be installed. Please consult the documentation for further guidance.

## Required Data sources
PolarRoute has been built to work with a variety of open-source atmospheric and oceanographic data sources. For testing and demonstration purposes it is also possible to generate artificial Gaussian Random Field data.  

A full list of supported data sources and their associated dataloaders is given in the 
'Dataloader Overview' section of the [MeshiPhi manual](https://antarctica.github.io/MeshiPhi/)

## Documentation
The documentation for the package is available to read at: https://antarctica.github.io/PolarRoute/

If you make changes to the source of the documentation you will need to rebuild the corresponding html files using Sphinx.
The dependencies for this can be installed through pip:
```
pip install sphinx sphinx_markdown_builder sphinx_rtd_theme rinohtype
```
When updating the docs, run the following command within the PolarRoute directory to recompile.
```
sphinx-build -b html ./docs/source ./docs/html
```
Sometimes the cache needs to be cleared for internal links to update. If facing this problem, run this from the PolarRoute directory.
```
rm -r docs/html/.doctrees/
```
