# PsychoPy Monkeys
This plugin adds Components to PsychoPy which immitate participant input while in piloting mode.

## Monkeys?
A monkey is a bit of code which simulates a human input, so pressing the keyboard, clicking the mouse, etc. without there being an actual human in front of the screen. Think of it like a monkey you'd trained to push random buttons.

## But... why?
Sometimes an experiment needs to be long and tedious when the participant is doing it, but that doesn't mean you need to sit through it every time too! Adding monkeys to your experiment means that you don't have to sit there mindlessly pushing buttons to check that your experiment runs as you expect. Instead, set up a monkey to do that for you, then you can sit back and relax while your experiment runs through! Monkeys only run when you're in pilot mode, in run mode they don't do anything, so when you run your experiment properly with a participant it'll go through as normal.
