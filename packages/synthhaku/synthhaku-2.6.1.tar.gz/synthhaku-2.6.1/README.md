<sup>
a debugging and utility extension for disnake bots
</sup>
synthhaku is an extension for bot developers that enables rapid prototyping, experimentation, and debugging of features for bots.

One of synthhaku's core philosophies is to be dynamic and easy-to-use. Here's the two step install:

> 1. Download synthhaku on the command line using pip:
> ```bash
> pip install -U synthhaku
> ```
> 2. Load the extension in your bot code before it runs:
> ```python
> bot.load_extension('synthhaku')
> ```
> That's it!

You can also import the module to use the command development utilities.
