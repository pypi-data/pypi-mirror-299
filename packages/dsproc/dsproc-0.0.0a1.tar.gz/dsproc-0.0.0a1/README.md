# dsproc: a powerful digital signals processing toolkit

## What is it?

**dsproc** is a Python package that enables the analysis and processing of digitized radio
signals using an intuitive and approachable framework. It supports end to end digital communcations,
 which gives users the ability to fully encode and modulate data into radio waves of all types.

## Main Features
Here are some of the things you can do with dsproc!
    
- Perform end to end digital signal processing! Compress, randomise, error correct, 
  interleave and then modulate data into a complex wave ready for transmitting through
  your software defined radio (SDR) of choice!
- Supports a variety of modulation and demodulation types such as ASK, FSK, QAM, MFSK,
  and PSK using symbols sets of arbitrary size.
- Create custom QAM constellations using a simple click gui.
- Use clustering to aid in automatic demodulation of FSK, ASK and QAM signals.
- Create spectrum art by converting images to waves and transmit them via SDR!

## Installation
To install dsproc and it's dependencies I recommend using the pip installer:
pip install dsproc
