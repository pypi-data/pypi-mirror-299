## Typing stubs for reportlab

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`reportlab`](https://github.com/MrBitBucket/reportlab-mirror) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`reportlab`.

This version of `types-reportlab` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `reportlab==4.2.5`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/reportlab. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
