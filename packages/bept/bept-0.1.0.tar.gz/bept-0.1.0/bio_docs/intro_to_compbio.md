## 1. What is Computational Biology?

Computational Biology can be roughly considered to be the amalgamation of several fields, such as mathematics, data science, chemistry with biology to understand and analyse various fields(of biology) such as genetics, neuroscience, etc.

## 2. How did it start?

The origins of computational biology, not too surprisingly, can be traced back to the origins of computation itself. The implementation of a model of biological morphogenesis (the development of pattern and form in living organisms) was started by British mathematician **Alan Turing** in the 1950s. This decade also witnessed the incorporation of computational methods in phylogenetics.

By the 1960s, computers could deal with complex structures such as proteins marking the rise of computational biology as a field. Computers had become an essential part of scientists' lives, especially in analysing the **3D structure of proteins**.

These were followed by the use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in solving complex biological problems. The **Human Genome Project(HGP)** played a pivotal role in the popularisation of the field.

## 3. What PEP focusses on?

PEP focusses on the application of Computational Biology in analysing the structure of proteins. It is a beginner-friendly tool for anyone who's interested to join the exciting field of computational biology and a step forward from existing Computational Biology tools in terms of user-friendliness and can be used by anyone who's willing and eager to learn.
