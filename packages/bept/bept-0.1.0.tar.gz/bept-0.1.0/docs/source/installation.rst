BEPT mainly uses ``pdb2pqr`` and ``apbs`` tool for running the

   separately. The latest version on Pypi will be installed
   automatically.
-  ``apbs`` is not shipped with BEPT and you need to install it
   separately. You can download it from
   `APBS <http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/>`__ official website, or as
   mentioned below.

If you are manually installing the tool, make sure the dependencies are
installed which are mentioned in the ``requirements.txt`` file by
running -

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

If you downloading via Pypi or Homebrew, these dependencies will be
installed automatically.

APBS and PDB2PQR Installation
-----------------------------

``bept`` focusses on the automation of the process of running PDB2PQR
and APBS. ``pdb2pqr`` is installed along with ``bept`` so you need not
worry. To install APBS, you can follow the below steps -

-  MacOS

.. code:: bash

   sudo port install apbs

-  Linux

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install apbs

-  For Windows, follow the instructions mentioned in the official APBS

Once all the dependencies are installed, you should be able to run
``bept --help`` and get the help message.
