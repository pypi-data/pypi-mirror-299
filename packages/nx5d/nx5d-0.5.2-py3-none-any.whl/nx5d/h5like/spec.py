'''
Provides a series of objects to mock an "ESRF dialect" of a HDF5-based Nexus
data file for X-ray diffraction experiments for SPEC files.
As an extra provision, detector data is loaded from external `.tiff` files
with an easily computable path. This is typical for older installation of
SPEC which couldn't handle and store large(-ish) 2D detector images.

The "ESRF dialect" is essentially this:

  - There is 1D or 2D detector data ("images" or "frames").

  - The data is organized in "scans", i.e. images are oranized in series.
    One scan typically consists of several images with the same hard characteristics
    (i.e. same geometry), but taken under systematically differing external parameters:
    e.g. by "scanning" one or several parameter devices (angle? time delay?) and
    obtaining an image at each of the scan points.

  - The data format where the images are stored is a 3-dimensional block of NxWxH,
    where 'WxH' is the width/height of one frame, and 'N' is the number of frames
    in a scan. For a scan performed along a single paramter, each subsequent frame
    corresponds to a different parameter instance; for a scan taken along 2 parameters
    (e.g. inside a 2D parameter space), the scans are interleaved: there are actually
    (n*m)xWxH frames. This is still a 3D dataset with images of geometry WxH, but
    the first "chunk" of 'n' images are scanned along the first paramter and a specific
    'm' value (i.e. all have the same 'm'), the next chunk is scanned again along the
    whole N space but for a different 'm', and so on.

  - Besides detector data, there are also associated metadata -- e.g. the parameter
    arrays along which the scans took place. These are also Nx(...) data sets; in the
    simplest cases, they are 2D (parameter is scalar).

  - The both detector data and scan metadata are stored at specific "paths" within
    the data container. In HDF5 terminology, this is the literal HDF5 path within
    the file (e.g. "data/rayonix/detector"). We don't make any assumptions about
    the tree organisation (yes, typically it follows NX data format rules, but...).

  - A data container (i.e. a "file") can contain one or several scans. Each scan
    has a top-level subdirectory of its own.

  - Beyond data series (detector and metadata), there can also exist single scalar
    values setting the state for the entire experiment (e.g. "photon_energy", or
    "center_pixel", ...).

  - [FIXME: haven't decided yet whether top-level scalar metadata still needs to
    be embedded into a scan (i.e. is per-scan only), or can also be at the very
    top. I think ESRF has the former...]

            instrumentName: A name/label for the instrument. For one, this is used to compile
              the location of where to insert the data from the external TIFF files (as
              specified by `tiffInsertFmt` and `tiffLinkFmt`); for another, this is used
              to determine the location of the TIFF files on disk relative to the
              SPEC file (as specified by `scanPathFmt`).
        
            framePathFmt: format for the image scan filepath.

            scanIndexNameFmt: string formatting that ties the scan number (on disk)
              and scan name (in teh SpecH5 naming) together.

            cache: This parameter is passed to `SpecH5LazyNode`. If set to `True` (the default),
              data from TIFF files in subnodes is cached in memory. This is generally what you
              want, except for rare cases where you are going to read all the data in memory
              first, and risk overwhelming your local RAM. This is the case, for instance,
              when you call `silx.io.convert.write_to_h5()` on a `SpecTiffH5` object which
              represents a large set of scans.

         All string formatters can make use of any or all of the following variables:
        
           - `{dirname}`: folder-only component of the spec file name

           - `{instr}`: the instrument name (from the `instrumentName` parameter above)
        
           - `{basename}`: base name the SPEC file, with the last component after a dot
             (typically ".spec" removed

           - `{scannr}`: scan number; this is typically an integer, assigned by "the
             algorithm", and typically starting with 1 for the first scan

           - `{scanidx}`: scan index; this is an integer starting with 0 and designating
             the cosecutive index value of the scan.

           - `{frameidx}`: the index (starting with 0) of the frame being processed
             (i.e. the TIFF file).

        In addition to the explicit parameters, we also use the following positional
        parameters from `args`:

           - `filename` (position 0): the path of the SPEC file to read
