# opensesame-coregraphics-eyelink

This package from SR Research Ltd. provides an implementation of the EyeLink Core Graphics library's callback-handling using OpenSesame libraries.

For OpenSesame users who are interested in scripting psychophysical experimental paradigms that integrate eye-tracking methodology using EyeLink devices from SR Research Ltd., this package provides the interface between the core API integration (c.f. [sr-research-pylink](https://pypi.org/project/sr-research-pylink/), a dependency package of opensesame-eyelink-coregraphics) and the graphics interface provided by the OpenSesame. This opensesame-eyelink-coregraphics package is a dependency of the [EyeLink plugin](https://pypi.org/project/opensesame-plugin-eyelink/) for OpenSesame from SR Research Ltd.
