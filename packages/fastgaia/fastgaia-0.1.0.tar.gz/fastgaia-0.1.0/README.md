# fastgaia

fastgaia is an implementation of gaia that can run 30x faster for large tree sequences in continuous space and improves inferences in the presence of internal samples.

## Features

- **Continuous Inference**: Infers continuous locations of nodes based on provided sample locations or tree sequence data.
- **Discrete Inference**: Infers discrete states of nodes with optional cost matrix considerations.
- **Flexible Output**: Outputs results in CSV format for easy analysis.

## Installation

You can install fastgaia via pip:

```bash
pip install fastgaia
