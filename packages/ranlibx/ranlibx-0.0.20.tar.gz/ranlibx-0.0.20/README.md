# ranx

This CLI is for some of the global RAN operations such as authentication through the terminal that are not necessarily needed if one were to be a consumer of the RAN the library.
For now, its purpose is for opening and closing receiver servers for auth through terminal, but it is also gonna be used as a global RAN CLI (project agnostic) so you can literally use it like an `npx` (or in this case, [px](https://github.com/AmeerArsala/px))

**NOTE: This is designed to be installed GLOBALLY (e.g. via `pipx`). This is so that users need only install it on their system one time and that's it.**
