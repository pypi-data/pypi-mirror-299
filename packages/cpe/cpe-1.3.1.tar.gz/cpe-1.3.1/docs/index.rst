CPE PACKAGE
===========

Welcome to cpe package documentation. In this pages you can find a tutorial about cpe package, that implements the validation of both CPE Names and platform (set of CPE Names) and the comparisons between them, corresponding to versions 1.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) specification. Also, this package gives support to name and language matching algorithms.

This documentation contains a brief introduction about Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) specification, the CPE version list implemented and the compatibility among them, the class model designed, the steps to install and use the cpe package (with examples), and several important issues to consider associated with the functionality of the package.
