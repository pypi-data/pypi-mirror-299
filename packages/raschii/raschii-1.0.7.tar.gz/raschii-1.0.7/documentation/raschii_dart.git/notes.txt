Notes for those not very familiar with Dart development and tools
(this includes the main author of RaschiiDart).


Building
--------

To build the two artifacts that make of RaschiiDart:

raschi_web.html:
    do nothing, this is already ready

raschii.js:
    Run dart2js on raschi_web.dart to generate this file:

    dart2js raschii_web.dart -o raschii.js

    You can add a flag "-m" to generate smaller code. This is recommended
    if you are not debugging the generated Javascript).


Unit testing
------------

To run the unit tests use the `pub` command:

    pub run tests
