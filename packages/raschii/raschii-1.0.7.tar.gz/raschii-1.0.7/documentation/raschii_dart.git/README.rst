RaschiiDart
===========

RaschiiDart is a Dart port of the Raschii_ Python library for constructing
non-linear regular waves. Both are named after `Thysanoessa raschii
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thysanoessa_raschii>`_, the Arctic Krill.

Supported wave models are currently:

- Stream function waves (M. M. Rienecker and J. D. Fenton, 1981)
- Stokes waves of 1st to 5th order (J. D. Fenton, 1985)
- Airy waves, standard linar cosine waves

.. _Raschii: https://bitbucket.org/trlandet/raschii

The reason for the Dart port is to make Raschii available as a web application
and the current tools for Python to Javascript transpilation were not up to the
task. Porting to Javascript would of course also have been an option, but the
author wanted to try something new and selected Dart over TypeScript and the
other competitors for no particular reason.

If you want to look at the code for the various wave models then the Python
implementation is better documented and easier to read due to use of numpy. In
the web world such libraries does not seem to exist.

Demo
----

An online demo can be found in the `documentation for the Python version of
Raschii <https://raschii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/raschii_dart.html>`_.

To build the code yourself run ``dart2js`` on the ``raschii_web.dart`` file. On
Ubuntu 2018.04 this means::

    /usr/lib/dart/bin/dart2js raschii_web.dart -o raschii.js

After compiling to javascript, open the raschii_web.html file in a web browser.
