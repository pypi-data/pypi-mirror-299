    Adjusts the gamma correction of an image.

    Parameters:
    image (ndarray): Input image (can be grayscale or RGB).

    Returns:
    ndarray: Image with adjusted gamma correction.

    Rescales the intensity of pixel values in an image.

    Parameters:

    in_range (tuple): Range of input values (min, max) for rescaling.
    out_range (tuple): Range of output values (min, max) after rescaling.
