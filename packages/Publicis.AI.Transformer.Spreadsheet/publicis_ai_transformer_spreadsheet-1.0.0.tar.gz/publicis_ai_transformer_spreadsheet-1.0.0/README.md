# An AI-based Conversion Tool

An AI-based Conversion Tool project created by RAGHU.

This project excels an intelligenct automation over spreadsheets. The project 
encapsulates few most important traversal algorithms and data engineering mechanism 
which helps the extraction, categorization, cleansing and finally the organisation
of data.

This project does not aim to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool
recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

----

This is the README file for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using
[reStructuredText][rst] or [markdown][md use] with the appropriate [key set][md
use]. It will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be
displayed as the project homepage on common code-hosting services, and should be
written for that purpose.

Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic
usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not a
good idea, although a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version
may be appropriate.
