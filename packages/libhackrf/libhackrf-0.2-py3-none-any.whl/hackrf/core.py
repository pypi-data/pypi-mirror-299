        Parameters
        ----------

            The number of bands is limited to MAX_SWEEP_RANGES as defined by libhackrf.
        num_bytes : int, optional
            Number of bytes to collect per tuning step, must be a multiple of 16384. Default is 16384.
        step_width : int, optional
            The width of each frequency step in Hz, default is 1000000 (1 MHz).
        pipe_function : callable, optional
            A function that handles data upon arrival. It takes a dictionary as an argument where keys are
            center frequencies and values are corresponding data bytes. The function should return a boolean
            indicating whether to stop the sweep. Default is None.
        step_offset : int, optional
            Offset to add to each tuning step. Default is the sampling rate divided by 2.
        interleaved : bool, optional
            If True, enable interleaved sweep style. Default is True.
        buffer_size : int, optional
            Size of the buffer for each band in bytes. Default is 16374.

        Raises
        ------
