# test_clODE_utilities
# - verify correctness of helper functions used in observers and solver

# norms
# - simple kernel, like opencl_builtins

# extended precision: sum, product, ...
# - test problems where this issue could arise?

# running means, variances [useful for stochastic too]
# - for sets, for time-average
# - test problems?

# interpolation [none: event timestamp is ti, linear, etc...]
# - harmonic oscillator's true value vs event value. dt may affect...
# {threshold times/states, local max times/states}
