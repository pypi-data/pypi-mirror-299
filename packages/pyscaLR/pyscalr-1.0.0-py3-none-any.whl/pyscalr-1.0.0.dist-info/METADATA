# Single-cell analysis using Low Resource (scaLR)

## ðŸ“– Overview 

<b>scaLR</b> is a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline that is equipped with a range of advanced features to streamline and enhance the analysis of scRNA-seq data. The major steps of the platform are:

1. <b>Data Processing</b>: Large datasets undergo preprocessing and normalization (if the user opts to) and are segmented into training, testing, and validation sets.

2. <b>Features Extraction</b>: A model is trained on feature subsets in a batch-wise process, so all features and samples are utilized in the feature selection process. Then, the top-k features are selected to train the final model, using a feature score based on the model's coefficients/weights.

3. <b>Training</b>: A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained on the training dataset. The validation dataset is used to validate the model at each epoch and early stopping is performed if applicable. Also, a batch correction method is available to correct batch effects during training in the pipeline.

4. <b>Evaluation & Downstream Analysis</b>: The trained model is evaluated using the test dataset by calculating metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. Various visualizations such as ROC curve of class annotation, feature rank plots, heatmap of top genes per class, DGE analysis, and gene recall curves are generated.

The following flowchart explains the major steps of the scaLR platform.

## Pre-requisites and installation scaLR


- ScalR can be installed using Conda or pip. It is tested in Python 3.9 and recommended to use that environment.

```
conda create -n scaLR_env python=3.9
```

- Clone the git repository and install the required packages by activating the conda environment.

```
conda activate scaLR_env

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input Data
- Currently the pipeline expects all datasets in [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/getting-started.html) formats (`.h5ad` files only).
- The anndata object should contain cell samples as `obs` and genes as `var`.
- `adata.X`: contains all gene counts/expression values.
- `adata.obs`: contains any metadata regarding cells, including a column for `target` which will be used for classification. The index of `adata.obs` is cell_barcodes.
- `adata.var`: contains all gene_names as Index.

             
## How to run

1. It is necessary that the user modify the configuration file and each stage of the pipeline is available inside the config folder [config.yml] or [full_config.yml] as per your requirements. Simply omit/comment out stages of the pipeline you do not wish to run.
2. Refer config.yml & it's detailed config [README](config_README.md) file on how to use different parameters and files.
3. Then use the `pipeline.py` file to run the entire pipeline according to your configurations. This file takes as argument the path to config (`-c | --config`), and an optional flag to log all parts of the pipelines (`-l | --log`).
4. `python pipeline.py --config /path/to/config -c config.yaml -l` to run the scaLR.
