            acquisition period or AQ
            The acquisition time, often denoted as AT, is the total duration for which the FID signal is recorded.
            It determines the length of the time domain signal. AT is usually set by the user and depends on the desired
            spectral width and resolution of the NMR spectrum.

            The number of data points or data values collected during the FID acquisition is determined by the user and
            should be specified before the experiment. It affects the digital resolution and sensitivity of the resulting
            NMR spectrum. The greater the number of data points, the finer the spectral resolution, but the longer the
            acquisition time.

"""
Zero Filling (ZF): Zero filling is a processing step performed after data acquisition to increase the number of data points in the FID. Zero filling involves interpolating zeros between the acquired data points to increase the apparent resolution. It can be used to enhance the resolution without changing the acquisition time.

    Apodization Function: Apodization is a mathematical operation applied to the FID to modify its shape and reduce sideband artifacts in the Fourier-transformed spectrum. Common apodization functions include exponential multiplication, Gaussian multiplication, and sine-bell functions. The choice of apodization function affects the line shape and resolution of the resulting spectrum.

    Frequency Offset (O1): The frequency offset (O1) represents the position of the spectral center relative to the transmitter frequency. It is set according to the region of interest in the NMR spectrum. The frequency offset can be applied during the acquisition to shift the FID to the desired spectral region.
