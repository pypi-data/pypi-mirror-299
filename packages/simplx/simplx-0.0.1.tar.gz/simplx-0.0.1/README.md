# SimplX

**SimplX** is a modern markup language designed to seamlessly combine natural text formatting with the power of embedded Python code, enabling users to create dynamic and richly formatted documents with ease. SimplX draws inspiration from popular markup languages like Markdown but goes further by introducing programming constructs, giving users the flexibility to generate content programmatically.

With SimplX, you can write structured text using an intuitive syntax, then leverage Python to automate content generation, define complex document logic, and create customized formatting styles -- all without leaving the flow of your document.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Python Integration**: Write and execute Python code within your document to define variables, perform calculations, or conditionally format text.
- **Simple and Readable Syntax**: Enjoy a syntax inspired by Markdown that allows you to write documents naturally, without complex tags or formatting commands.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Use Python loops, functions, and libraries to generate tables, graphs, or any repetitive content directly in your document.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Define your own commands, styles, and templates to extend SimplX's capabilities and make document authoring more efficient.
