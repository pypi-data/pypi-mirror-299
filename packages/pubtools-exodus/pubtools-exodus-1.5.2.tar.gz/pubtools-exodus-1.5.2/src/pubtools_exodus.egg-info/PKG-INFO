        -----------
        
        Patches may be contributed via pull requests to
        https://github.com/release-engineering/pubtools-exodus.
        
        All changes must pass the automated test suite, along with various static
        checks.
        
        The [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style is enforced.
        Enabling autoformatting via a pre-commit hook is recommended:
        
        ```
        pip install black pre-commit
        pre-commit install
        ```
