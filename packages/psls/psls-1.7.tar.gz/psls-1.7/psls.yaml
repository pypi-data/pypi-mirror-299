    Type: PLATO_SIMU #  either 'User' or 'PLATO_SCALING' or 'PLATO_SIMU'.
# 'User': the NSR value is specified by the user (see below) 
# 'PLATO_SCALING': the NSR value is obtained by interpolating, at the given magnitude, the NSR scaling relation expected for PLATO
# 'PLATO_SIMU': the NSR is taken from realistic simulated ligth-curves (stored in the systematics error table, see below) and vary with the mask shapes and thus then the latter are updated
    NSR :  73. # User-specified Noise to Signal Ratio [ppm in one hour] for a single camera. This value takes into account all random noises but does not include systematic errors.
  Systematics:
    Enable : 1
# The binary file containing the systematics parameters:

#    Table :  systematics/PLATO_systematics_BOL_FixedMask_V2.npy # representative for the sample P5 stars, with fixed mask during the quarter
#    Table :  systematics/PLATO_systematics_BOL_P1_V2.npy # representative for the sample P1 stars

# Stellar parameters
Star:
  Mag : 10. #  V magnitude (John V magnitude). The V magnitude is converted into the PLATO P magnitude using the star effective temperature following Marchiori et al (2019, A&A)'s Teff-magnitude relation.
  ID : 12069449  #  star ID (arbitrary number)
  ModelType: single  # Type of  pulsation model, can be either 'UP', 'grid', 'grid-old' 'single', or 'text'.

  ModelName: 0012069449  # Name of the input pulsation model, to be specified when ModelType = 'single' or 'text'.
  # The input  pulsation model can be either a .gsm file (generated by ADIPLS)
  #  a simple TEXT file
  # or an HDF5 file storing a grid of CESAM2K models.
  # In the cas of a TEXT file, the latter shall provide the mode properties (in 3 columns: frequency, width and height). Mode frequencies and mode widths are in muHz and mode heights are in ppm^2/muHz. For the mode heights a "single-sided" spectrum is assumed.

  # Spot component (Dorren (1987)'s model)
