# py-solfege

A Python library for dealing with musical scales and there solfÃ¨ge.

## Why?

I wanted a library that I could ask for "in this key, what is the solfege name for this note?"

JS has the [VexFlow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vexflow) library that could do the scale, but I needed this in Python.

I was unable to find a complete implementation in Python.
All other projects I found on Pypi.org, github.com, and using Google search did NOT handle non-diatonic notes (and many required numpy as a dependency -> which is a quite heavy handed dependency for such a task...).
