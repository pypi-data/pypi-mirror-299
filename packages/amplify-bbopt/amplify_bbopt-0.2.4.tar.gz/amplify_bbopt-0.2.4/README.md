Amplify-BBOpt is built around the [Amplify SDK](https://amplify.fixstars.com/en/docs/amplify/). Annealing-based black-box optimization methods, FMQA and kernel-QA, are available in conjunction with quantum annealing machines and Ising machines (hence using Amplify SDK). Important features include (but not limited to):

* Easy to run and change methods
* Applicability to high-dimensional problems
* Consideration of constraints
* Multi-objective optimization
