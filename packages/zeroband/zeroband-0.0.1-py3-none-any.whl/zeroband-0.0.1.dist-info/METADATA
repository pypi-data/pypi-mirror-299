# XoT: A Modular X of Thought Library

XoT is a Python library designed to facilitate the creation, sharing, and training of X of Thought (XoT) strategies.

The core objectives of XoT are:
1. Make strategies easy to use and share.
2. Facilitate self-learning and self-evolving strategies
3. Enable systems that advance scientific progress

Inspired by PyTorch's modular design, DSPy's signature-based approach, and Hugging Face's emphasis on shareability, XoT offers a powerful framework for building multi-modal reasoning systems that can be fine-tuned and shared across different tasks and domains.

# Installation
```bash
pip install xot
```

# Example Usage

## Loading strategy from hub
```python
from xot import AutoStrategy
from datasets import load_dataset

strat = AutoStrategy.from_pretrained('PrimeIntellect/Numina-TIR')
ds = load_dataset('openai/gsm8k')
print(strat)

for q, a in zip(ds['question'], ds['answer'])
    output, log = strat(q, output_log=True)
    print(output, a)
```

## Creating your own strategy and pushing it to the hub
```python
import xot

# Define a simple strategy
class MyStrategy(xot.Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.rationale = xot.steps.Rationale("Provide detailed image prompt to improve aesthetics")
        self.image_gen = xot.steps.AutoImageGenerator.from('black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev')

    def forward(self, input: str):
        prompt = self.rationale(input)
        image = self.image_gen(prompt)
        return image

strat = MyStrategy()
print(strat)

img = strat("porsche 911")
img.save('porsche_911.png')

strat.push_to_hub('my_username')
```

# Getting Started
To get started with XoT, check out the [documentation](/) which provides detailed guides on creating strategies, fine-tuning them and sharing your work with the community.

# Core Concepts

## Strategy
A Strategy in XoT is the overarching blueprint that defines how an agent thinks and reasons. It encapsulates the following components:

- **Objective / Vision:** The high-level goal or purpose of the strategy.
- **Policy / Constitution:** The guiding principles or methods used to achieve the objective.

## Configuration
Configuration is where the fine-tuning happens. It allows users to customize the behavior of their strategies through:

- **Hyperparameters:** Key variables that influence the behavior of the strategy.
- **Distributions:** Ranges or specific values that hyperparameters can take, enabling higher diversity trajectories for synthetic data generation.

## Step
A Step represents a single unit of reasoning or action within a strategy.
Steps are defined by their Signatures—a general template describing what the step should accomplish without being tied to a specific implementation.

Steps can be categorized as:
- Reasoning:
  - Rationale: Logic or explanation behind decisions.
  - Explainer: Components that provide understandable justifications.
- Tools:
  - ImageGenerator: Generates images based on input data.
  - Calculator: Performs arithmetic or logical calculations.
  - Terminal: Executes shell commands or scripts.
  - WebSearch: Queries the web for information.
  - FunctionCall: Calls a specific function or API.
- Modality Adapters:
  - TextToImage: Converts text input to an image format.
  - ImageToText: Converts image input to a text format.
  - ...and more for Audio, Video, Graphs, Time series, etc.
- Memory Interfaces:
  - ShortTerm: Components managing short-term memory.
  - LongTerm: Components managing long-term memory.
  - Working: Components for active, working memory.
- Diversifier:
  - Components specialized in generating diverse training data, crucial for robust strategy development.


## Metrics
XoT includes built-in Metrics to evaluate the performance of strategies and individual steps.
Metrics help in understanding the effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the reasoning process.
- Accuracy
  - Equality: This can be by equality, embedding closeness or as evaluated by an LLM / VLM.
  - Constraint satisfaction: This can be through code execution or as evaluated by an LLM
- Scoring
  - Code execution (time / efficiency / others)
  - LLM Review
  - Game Score
- ELO / Winrate
  - Versus other generations: This can be through code execution or as evaluated by an LLM
- Ranking
  - Inversions / Kendall Tau Correlation

## Visualisation
Visualisations provides tools for inspecting and understanding the behavior of strategies.
This feature is crucial for debugging, sharing and communicating strategies with others.

- Agent Architecture Diagram | State Machine Diagram
  - High level overview of the strategies steps and their interactions
  - Could include modules like perception, decision-making, action-selection, etc.
  - Allows visualizing specific components. Allowing the user to specify granularity to achieve this might be a good idea.
  - Steps are related directionally and can branch and merge and loop
- Goal Hierarchy
  - Visualize goals and subgoals
- Beliefs-Desire-Intention (BDI) Model
  - Represent the strategies beliefs, desire and intentions
- Trace visualisations of specific trajectories
- Performance metrics and progress

# Key Features
- PyTorch-inspired Composability: Design reasoning components using a familiar and flexible modular system akin to PyTorch’s nn.Module, but for thought processes.
- Modality-Agnostic Design: Supports a wide range of input and output modalities, including text, image, audio, video, graphs, and more.
- Strategy Sharing and Fine-Tuning: Emphasis on reusing and fine-tuning existing strategies rather than starting from scratch, making it easy to adapt strategies to new tasks.
- Dataset Generation and Trajectory Evaluation: Built-in support for creating diverse datasets and evaluating the paths taken by reasoning strategies.
- Flexible Configuration System: Customize your strategies with fine-grained control over prompts, weights, and other hyperparameters.
- Agent Support: Special subsets of strategies designed for memory-intensive tasks, with support for various types of memory interfaces.
