# A tool for converting large SVS files into segmented small JPG/PNG files by OpenSlide(developing)

Here is an early file processing tool that uses deep learning methods to analyze pathological sections. Its specific function is to divide a larger SVS file (about several GB) into smaller JPG files, providing the material needed for deep learning. The project is still under development.

The expected goal to be achieved is:

* Specify the selected SVS format file via the command line or search for all SVS format files in the specified directory, and designate the generation directory and format.

* Encapsulate the code to create a software or tool package.

* Add post-processing tools for the generated images, such as format conversion tools.

* Provide multi-opening functionality, while also offering multi-threaded processing.
