***************
The Scotty tool
***************

Scotty
======

``SimpleCore™ open technology tool for you`` or short ``Scotty`` is a tool used to
operate with the SimpleCore™ BSP, helping to download sources and build BSP images. It
relies on docker to provide a reproducible build environment.

``Scotty`` can either be used as a single command to build a full image or as a
helper to setup Yocto sources and open a shell with a Yocto environment.

Getting started
---------------

The scotty tool relies on a docker container to embed as much as possible the
software dependencies it relies on. As a consequence, you will need to make sure
to install `Docker<https://www.docker.com/>` on your system and make sure your
user has rights to use docker.
The scotty tool also needs `OpenSSL<https://www.openssl.org/>` to function properly.

On Ubuntu 20.04 platforms, they can be installed with following commands::

    $ sudo apt install docker.io openssl
    $ sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker

In addition, if you plan to use QEMU images, it is advised to make sure the
current user is able to use `KVM <https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page>`_,
having write permissions to ``/dev/kvm``. On Ubuntu 20.04, this can be done by
adding your user to the ``kvm`` group, with the following command::

    $ sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} kvm

.. note::
    After adding your user to the docker or kvm group with the ``gpasswd``
    command, you will need to open a new session to apply your new privileges.

Installing the scotty tool can be easily done with ``pip``

.. code:: shell

  pip install --user avnet-scotty

upgrading an existing installation can be done with

.. code:: shell

  pip install --user --upgrade avnet-scotty

.. important::

  On Ubuntu 20.04 you might be affected by `this bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bash/+bug/1588562>`_,
  so ``${HOME}/.local/bin`` is not part of the standard search path.

  This can be fixed by running

  .. code-block:: console

    echo 'export PATH="$(systemd-path user-binaries):$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

  .. note::

    A reboot is required for the setting to become effective.

  You can also install ``scotty`` with

  .. code-block:: console

    sudo pip install avnet-scotty

  but that requires you to have ``sudo`` rights on your system.


Alternatively, the current development version can be obtained by cloning
`<https://github.com/avnet-embedded/simplecore-tools>`_.

.. admonition:: Potential pitfall
  :class: ATTENTION

  If you are facing the following issue

  .. code-block:: text

    Error response from daemon: Head "https://ghcr.io/v2/avnet-embedded/scotty/manifests/2023.10": denied: denied
    scotty failed on line 157
  
  please run

  .. code-block:: console

    docker logout ghcr.io

  on your computer.

  To fix it permantely, please create a personal access token, as described at :ref:`sources/simplecore-distro/docs/simpleswitch/tutorial-base-images/container-helper/ghcr:Github container registry (GHCR)`
  with at least ``read:packages`` permissions.

  And re-login to docker using

  .. code-block:: console

    docker login ghcr.io

Github preparations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we can start to build, we need to make sure that Github allows us to connect via ssh.

See this video on how to do it

.. youtube:: s6KTbytdNgs

Please also keep in mind that most of the repositories are only available for users being
part of `avnet-embedded GitHub organization <https://github.com/avnet-embedded>`_.

Please reach out to support to request access.

Running scotty on a different docker image
------------------------------------------

By default scotty will use the corresponding version of the `scotty docker image <https://github.com/orgs/avnet-embedded/packages/container/package/scotty>`_.
To use a different docker image run::

  $ SCOTTY_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image> scotty ...

e.g. to use the latest development version::

  $ SCOTTY_DOCKER_IMAGE="ghcr.io/avnet-embedded/simplecore-tools:kirkstone" scotty ...

to use a different release::

  $ SCOTTY_DOCKER_IMAGE="ghcr.io/avnet-embedded/scotty:<release tag>" scotty ...

Scotty subcommands
------------------

Several commands are supported by Scotty, with different goals:
  - ``update``: download or update the Yocto sources. Will be triggered
    implicitly with default parameters if no sources are found.
  - ``setup``: Setup the build directory. Will be triggered implicitly with
    default parameters if the build directory has not been setup.
  - ``bitbake``: Build a Yocto target.
  - ``shell``: Run a shell in the Yocto build environment.
  - ``command``: Run a command in the Yocto build environment.
  - ``docker-update``: Update Scotty build container.
  - ``info``: Print out information.

Setup your build
----------------

With

.. code-block:: bash

   $ scotty setup

you can configure your build through our interactive UI.

.. note::

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ scotty setup --force

  Will allow you to redo the configuration at any point.


Building a full image
---------------------

A single command is enough to download the sources and build an image:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ scotty bitbake core-image-minimal

Built images can then be found in ``build/build/tmp/deploy/images/``.

The build target can be customized:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ scotty bitbake core-image-minimal
   $ scotty bitbake -- core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk

.. note::

  The available images/SDKs can be displayed by running

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ scotty info images

Recommended hardware setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For building software pacakges with ``Scotty`` we recommend the following minimal hardware setup:

For base images

- 4 Cores / 8 threads CPU
- 16GB RAM
- 200GB HDD

For SDKs

- 16 Cores / 32 threads CPU
- 64Gb RAM
- 500GB HDD

.. note::

  Other combinations do work as well, but keep in mind that we at least require 2GB of RAM per available CPU thread.

Using Scotty as a helper
------------------------

``Scotty`` can be used to open a shell with a sourced Yocto environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ scotty shell

It can also be used to run a single command without opening a shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   # This is equivalent to scotty bitbake core-image-minimal
   $ scotty command bitbake core-image-minimal

   $ scotty command bitbake-layers show-appends

Updating sources
----------------

Scotty will not modify downloaded sources by itself after the initial setup.
Building an image with up-to-date sources can be done using following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ scotty update
   $ scotty bitbake core-image-minimal

Advanced configuration
----------------------

Scotty can be used to download extra sources, add additional layers or tweak the
configuration.

Supported update arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``--manifest-branch``: Set repo branch used for repo init.
- ``--manifest-url``: Set repo url used for repo init.
- ``--manifest-name``: Set repo manifest used for repo init.
- ``--extra-download``: Add an extra git to download. If this is a layer, it can
  then be used in setup with ``--extra-layer``.

Supported setup arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- ``--build-dir``: Set build subdirectory, subdirectory of ``build``. Can be
  used to have different builds in the same ``build`` folder.
- ``--machine-dir``: specify the directories where scotty should look for
  supported machines.
- ``--extra-layer``: Add an extra local layer.
- ``--extra-conf``: Add an extra configuration entry in local.conf.
- ``--extra-env``: Pass on additional environment variables.
- ``--sstate-mirrors``: Do use any sstate mirror (default = false).
- ``--features-layers-set``: The set of Tria extra layers to use.
- ``--machine-dir``: specify the directories where scotty should look for
  supported machines.

.. note::

  The currently available ``--features-layers-set`` can be displayed by running

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ scotty info feature-sets

Supported bitbake, shell and command arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``--build-dir``: Set build subdirectory, subdirectory of ``build``. Can be
  used to have different builds in the same ``build`` folder.

Scripting configuration
-----------------------

It might be useful to skip the configuration menu, so Scotty can be used in a
scripted way. To help with this, most configuration can be set either through
arguments or environment variables.

Supported arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``--features-layers-set`` of the ``setup`` subcommand can be used to bypass
layer sets selection.


Supported environment variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``DISTRO``: Can be used to select the Yocto distro and skip selection menu.
- ``MACHINE``: Can be used to select the Yocto machine and skip selection menu.
- ``ACCEPT_FSL_EULA``: Can be used to set the Freescale/NXP EULA status and skip
  selection menu if applicable).
- ``LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED``: Can be use to allow e.g. commercial licenses in the resulting images.
- ``UBOOT_ENV_VARS``: Can be use to prepopulate the used u-boot environment (expects a key value list, separated by new lines). To disable pass " ".
- ``SCOTTY_FEATURE_LAYERS``: A space separated list of feature layers (alternative to ``scotty setup --features-layers-set`` - CLI flags have always precedence).

Example
^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export ACCEPT_FSL_EULA=1
   $ export LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED=commercial
   $ DISTRO=simplecore-distro MACHINE=sm2s-imx8plus scotty setup --features-layers-set distro
   $ scotty bitbake core-image-minimal

In addition, it is possible to tweak Scotty behaviour using the environment:

- ``SCOTTY_ALLOWLIST``: The list of host environment variables exposed in Yocto
  environment.
- ``DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS``: Additional parameters for docker.

Example

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export DOCKER_EXTRA_ARGS="-v /home/downloads:/home/scotty/build/downloads -v /home/sstate-cache:/home/scotty/build/sstate-cache"
   $ scotty bitbake core-image-minimal


Using Scotty on Windows
-----------------------

Scotty has been tested on Windows with WSL2.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: The following will need Administator permission
  :class: ATTENTION

  - enable and install ``Windows subsystem for Linux 2`` like decribed `here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>`_.

    We recommend to use the ``Ubuntu`` virtual machine for WSL2.

    **NOTE** only version 2 of WSL is supported.

- install `docker on WSL2 <https://dev.to/bowmanjd/install-docker-on-windows-wsl-without-docker-desktop-34m9>`_
- install ``openssh``

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install openssh-server

- install ``pip``

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt update
  $ sudo apt install -y python3-pip

and finally install ``scotty``

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip3 install avnet-scotty

Configure WSL2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended to disable the `/etc/resolv.conf updating`.
For that run from within the WSL2 VM

.. code-block:: console

  $ echo "[network]" >> /etc/wsl.conf
  $ echo "generateResolvConf = false" >> /etc/wsl.conf

now close the WSL2 VM window.

Dependending on the CPU count and the available RAM of your Windows machine you'll need to configure the following:

From a ``cmd.exe`` on Windows

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd %userprofile%
  $ notepad .wslconfig

Now add the following to the file

.. code-block:: ini

  [wsl2]
  processors=<Amount of RAM in GB / 4>
  swap=<Free disk space in GB - 150>GB

so for a Windows PC with 16 cores, 16GB of RAM and 300GB of free disk space that would be

.. code-block:: ini

  [wsl2]
  processors=4
  swap=150GB

save the file, close the window and run

.. code-block:: console

  $ wsl --shutdown

after that you can launch your WSL VM and start using ``scotty``.

SSH keys
^^^^^^^^

For ``scotty`` to work properly you'll need to create and reference SSH keys for Github, like
described `on this page <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent>`_.

Reusing your SSH keys from Windows
##################################

In case you want to reuse your SSH keys from windows just run

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir -p ~/.ssh
  $ cp /mnt/c/Users/<your Windows username>/.ssh/* ~/.ssh/
  $ chmod 0400 ~/.ssh/id_*

Using WSL2 with VSCode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'll need to install `this extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl>`_ in your VSCode
and configure it like shown on the website.

Using Scotty without Docker
---------------------------

If needed, Scotty can be used without docker. In this case, you are in charge of
providing a fully configured environment. This can be done by setting the
``SCOTTY_USE_DOCKER`` environment variable::

    $ SCOTTY_USE_DOCKER=0 scotty bitbake core-image-minimal

Scotty Runqemu
==============

``Scotty Runqemu`` is an additional tool allowing to start QEMU to run a QEMU targeted build.

Runqemu Example
---------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export DISTRO=simplecore-distro MACHINE=qemux86-64
   $ scotty setup --features-layers-set examples
   $ scotty bitbake simplecore-weston-demo-image
   $ scotty-runqemu simplecore-weston-demo-image

.. note::

  In case your machine does not offer KVM support run

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ SCOTTY_QEMUNOKVM=1 SCOTTY_ALLOWLIST="QEMU_USE_KVM" QEMU_USE_KVM=0 scotty-runqemu --extra-env=QEMU_USE_KVM simplecore-weston-demo-image

.. note::

  In you like to start an image in headless mode (no graphics) run

  .. code-block:: bash
    
    $ SCOTTY_QEMUNOGPAHIC=1 scotty-runqemu simplecore-weston-demo-image

scotty-test
===========

``scotty-test`` is a helper tool to run tests on real hardware.
It will guide the user through the needed steps and create a test report.

To run you will need

- an Azure access token ``SAS_TOKEN``
- access to `simplecore-tools <https://github.com/avnet-embedded/simplecore-tools>`_ repository
- a Github account
- a computer running Linux
  - ``sudo``, ``dd``, ``git`` installed
  - your git client propely setup
- a SDCard
- Internet access
- the hardware you want to test

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ SAS_TOKEN=abcdef scotty-test

The tool will download the necessary images and SDKs, run the tests and create a Markdown report that will
be pushed to the `simplecore-tools repository <https://github.com/avnet-embedded/simplecore-tools>`_.

Manual or Automatic tests
-------------------------

The user can choose to run manual tests, meaning that all the tests will be run but some will need an interaction with the user. For example, the user will have to change switches or measure the pins' voltage with a multimeter.

Otherwise if the user chooses automatic tests, it will run only the tests that do not need an interaction with the user. And for example, if there is a GPIO Expander connected, it will use it to check the voltage of the pins automatically.

Use Labgrid
-----------

Labgrid is a tool for automated testing. It can be used to flash the SD Card used for the tests.

To run the tests with Labgrid the user will need:

- a `SDWireC <https://badgerd.nl/sdwirec/>`_
- a `Numato GPIO Expander <https://numato.com/product/16-channel-usb-gpio-module-with-analog-inputs/>`_
- a serial connection to the board
- a `Tasmota power plug <https://www.amazon.fr/Connect%C3%A9es-Intelligentes-Telecommande-Sonsommation-intelligente/dp/B0CV4CV1XN>`_
- a USB hub

It is then necessary to configure the exporter file corresponding to the machine in tools/labgrid/client/.

For the serial port, the SDWireC and the Numato GPIO Expander, it is possible to use this kind of command to get the ID_PATH:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB0

For the Tasmota Power, it is possible to get the topics names after seting it up using the `manual <https://nous.technology/product/a1t.html?show=manual>`_.

Labgrid creates places for each board and associates to them a serial port, a SDWireC, a GPIO Expander and a Tasmota power plug. 
The user can check the places acquired by Labgrid at 172.17.0.2. 

Labgrid flashes the image automatically thanks to the SDWireC and then gives the IP address of the board to scotty-test so it could run the tests. 

scotty-layers.yaml
==================

All the information ``scotty`` uses is defined in ``scotty-layers.yaml`` in the ``manifest`` repository.
This file is a ``yaml`` file containing the following sections:

base section
------------

Allowed number of sections in the ``yaml``: 1

This section defines the layers that are **always** used in any setup.

+-------------+--------+----------------------------+--------------------------------------+

.. code:: yaml

  feature_myfeature:
    menu_priority: 200
    description: "My feature layer"
    layers: &layers_myfeature
      <<: [*layers_poky]
      ? "meta-myfeature"
    supported_distros: &distros_myfeature
      <<: [*distros_poky]

defines a feature that is called ``My feature layer``. It will add ``meta-myfeature`` to the layer set, and is only applicable
if ``poky`` is selected as a DISTRO. By selecting this feature all layers defined by the ``poky`` DISTRO will be setup as well.

scotty-layers.ext.yaml
======================

``scotty`` will additionally scan for ``scotty-layers.ext.yaml`` in the checked out repositories.
These files are written in the same syntax as ``scotty-layers.yaml`` and allow the standard ``scotty-layers.yaml`` to be extended.

The files have to be placed in the root of the bitbake layer.
