Experiment Directory Layout
===========================

The Experiment Directory Layout (EDL) is a specification for a storage layout for data
from scientific experiments, with primary focus on neuroscientific data.
It was originally developed for the `Syntalos <https://syntalos.github.io/>`_
DAQ system, but can be used elsewhere.

These pages document both the format itself, as well as Python API to easily
read any data contained in an EDL directory structure.
