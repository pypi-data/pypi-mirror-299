# EDL - Experiment Directory Layout

[![QA](https://github.com/bothlab/edlio/actions/workflows/python-qa.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bothlab/edlio/actions/workflows/python-qa.yml)

This repository contains specifications for the "Experiment Directory Layout" (EDL) storage layout as
used by the [Syntalos](https://github.com/bothlab/syntalos) data acquisition tool.

It also contains a Python module, `edlio`, to easily load and save data in an EDL structure
for simplified raw experiment data management.

Check out the [online documentation](https://edl.readthedocs.io/latest/) to learn more about this project!
