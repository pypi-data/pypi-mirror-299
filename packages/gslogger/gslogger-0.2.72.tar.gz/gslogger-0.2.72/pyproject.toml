long_description = "# GSLogger: Greg's Simple Changelog Generator\n\n- A Python-based tool for generating changelogs in Markdown format.\n- created by: [Friar Greg Denyes](https://github.com/friargregarious)\n- Licensed under: Apache License Version 2.0\n\n- app can be found at\n    - PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/GSLogger/0.1.0/ \n    - Github: https://github.com/friargregarious/glogger\n\n## Urls\n\n- [Bug Reports / Issues](https://github.com/friargregarious/glogger/issues) : https://github.com/friargregarious/glogger/issues\n- [Funding / Buy me a coffee!](https://paypal.me/friargreg?country.x=CA&locale.x=en_US) : https://paypal.me/friargreg\n- [Say Hi or Thanks!](https://mastodon.social/@gregarious) : https://mastodon.social/@gregarious\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/friargregarious/glogger) : https://github.com/friargregarious/glogger\n\n## Features\n\n* Automatically generates changelogs based on user input\n* Supports multiple changelog entries\n* Uses Markdown formatting for easy readability\n\n## Usage & initialization\n\n### create logs\n\nTo use the changelog generator run it from the command line and follow the prompts.\n\n```cmd\nc:\\myproject>glog\n```\n\nIf this is the first run, here is where you will be asked details about the app and the developer/contributor. Newly created changelog artifacts will be stored in ```c:\\myproject\\ch-logs\\``` directory as ```c:\\myproject\\ch-logs\\<date>.txt``` files. These can be opened and edited any time before being collected.\n\n*example:*\n\n```txt\n2024-09-24-18-09\nADDED\nthis is an example of a changelog artifact message for the updated README.md\nGregory Denyes <Greg.Denyes@gmail.com>\n```\n\n### Collecting logs & Versioning\n\nFor collecting artifacts and incrementing the current version, use the ```-c``` flag like so:\n\n```cmd\nc:\\myproject>glog -c\n```\n\nAny artifacts containing ```--r``` or ```--f``` will force increment **Major Release** or **Feature** versioning psuedo-Semantically. All existing artifacts will be processed and stored in ```~myproject\\ch-logs\\log_store.json```.\n\n### Generating Changelog.md\n\nGenerate the changelog.md from the ```~myproject\\ch-logs\\log_store.json``` file by using the ```-g``` flag like so:\n\n```cmd\nc:\\myproject>glog -g\n```\n\nVersion details will be sorted by version, and all parts of the final Changelog will be output to ```~myproject\\changelog.md```\n\n## Configuration\n\nOn first run, if this file and the configuration are not present, app will automatically begin asking for these details and save them to a newly created file. The tool uses a ```glog.json``` file to store the configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"CHTYPES\": [\n        \"FUTURE UPDATES\",\n        \"ADDED\",\n        \"CHANGED\",\n        \"REMOVED\",\n        \"FIXED\",\n        \"SECURITY\"\n    ],\n    \"app\": {\n        \"app_title\": \"GSLogger\",\n        \"atf_pattern\": \".txt\",\n        \"build_number\": 123,\n        \"f_count\": 3,\n        \"version_number\": [\n            0,\n            2,\n            70\n        ]\n    },\n\n```\n\nThis section contains your name and email for proper labelling of contributors to the changelog.\nwhen first initiating the app, you will be asked to either allow the app to pull from your git profile,\nor enter it manually.\n\n```json\n\"dev\": {\n        \"dev_email\": \"Greg.Denyes@gmail.com\",\n        \"dev_link\": \"https://github.com/friargregarious\",\n        \"developer\": \"Gregory Denyes\"\n    },\n```\n\nThis section contains full paths to the files & folders that will be used by this tool.\n\n```json\n    \"paths\": {\n        \"CWD\": \"\",\n        \"DIR_OUTPUT\": \"\",\n        \"FILE_CONFIG\": \"\",\n        \"FILE_LOG\": \"\",\n        \"FILE_OUTPUT\": \"\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n*Note: future features includes a re-calibrate command to update and change these settings if user wants to.*\n\n## Output\n\nThe generated changelog is stored in a file called ```changelog.md``` in the app's root directory.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to the development of this tool, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.\n"
