Wikimore is a simple frontend for Wikimedia projects. It uses the MediaWiki API to fetch data from Wikimedia projects and display it in a user-friendly way. It is built using Flask.

This project is still in development and more features will be added in the future. It is useful for anyone who wants to access Wikimedia projects with a more basic frontend, or to provide access to Wikimedia projects to users who cannot access them directly, for example due to state censorship.

## Features

- Supports all Wikimedia projects in all languages
- Search functionality
- Proxy support for Wikimedia images
