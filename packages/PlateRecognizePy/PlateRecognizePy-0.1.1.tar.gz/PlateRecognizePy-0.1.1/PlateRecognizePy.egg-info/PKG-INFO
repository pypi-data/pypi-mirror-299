Description: # PlateRecognizePy
        
        PlateRecognizePy is a Python library for license plate detection and recognition. It provides a simple interface to process images containing license plates and extract the plate text.
        
        ## Features
        
        - License plate detection in images
        - Text recognition from license plates
        - Support for both Tesseract OCR and EasyOCR
        - Automatic saving of original and processed images
        - Logging of detection and recognition results
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install PlateRecognizePy using pip:
        
        ```
        pip install PlateRecognizePy
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        PlateRecognizePy requires Python 3.7 or later. The main dependencies are:
        
        - [pytesseract](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)
        - [easyocr](https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/)
        - [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
        - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
        
        For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the `setup.py` file.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here's a simple example of how to use PlateRecognizePy:
        
        ```python
        from plate_recognize_py import process_license_plate
        import cv2
        
        # Load an image
        image = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg')
        
        # Process the image
        license_plate, text = process_license_plate(image)
        
        print(f"Detected license plate: {text}")
        ```
