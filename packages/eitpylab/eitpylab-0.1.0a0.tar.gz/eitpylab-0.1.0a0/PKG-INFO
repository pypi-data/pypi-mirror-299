EITpyLab is an innovative open-source project designed to serve as an educational tool for learning Electral Impedance Tomography (EIT) using the Python programming language. Developed initially for educational purposes at UFABC university, EITpyLab is poised to become a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals worldwide interested in the field of EIT in medical applications.

## 🔬 What is Electral Impedance Tomography (EIT)?

Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive tomographic imaging technique that estimates the distribution of electrical properties 
within a target. EIT systems make electrical stimulations using surface electrodes and measure the resulting voltages at the surface at 
combinations of the same electrodes, from which tomographic images of electrical impeditivity distribution are generated.

Although EIT is no longer a new technology, new uses are developed all the time. Global research has drastically increased after its 
commercial availability, and has slowly begun to make its way into industry and some areas of medicine.

EIT is a promising method for the development of noninvasive diagnostic medicine, as it is able to provide functional imaging of the body without 
ionizingg radiation. EIT has several applications in medicine, including but not limited to: functional imaging of the lungs, diagnosis of 
pulmonary embolism, detection of tumors, diagnosis and distinction of normal and suspected abnormal tissue within the same 
organ, bedside monitoring of lung perfusion and respiratory function, cerebral circulation, and stroke monitoring.

## 💻 Getting Started 

To get started with EITpyLab, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EITpyLab.git`
2. Create a virtual enviroment (recommended):
    Following the guidelines provided by PEP 405, you can create a virtual enviroment by executing the command venv:

    a. Install virtualenv lib: ````pip install virtualenv````
    
    b. Run venv command in your root directory with the path name that should be created

    ````bash
    python3 -m venv ./venv/
    `````

    This command will create your virtual env in the root's project.

2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> :bulb: **Tip:** This project also supports Poetry for dependence management. You can you the venv created by Poetry or crete one by yourself. After configure you enviroment, you can run ```poetry install``` in your terminal to install all dependencies needed.

> :warning: **Warning:** Do not upload your machine poetry.lock file to the repo. Our .gitignore prevents this to not happen. But, be careful :grimacing:

3. You can explore the documentation and tutorials provided in the `py_eit` branch. To run it, in development mode, you will need to use ```mkdocs``` lib (already a requirement in .toml file :smile:).
To build it in your local machine, you will need to run the command below in your terminal

````
mkdocs serve
````

> :warning: **Attention:** Check if the you're in the same directory as the mkdocs.yml. You should run the command in the root folder in the py_eit branch!

4. Experiment with the sample datasets and reconstruction algorithms included in the `examples/` directory.
5. Contribute to the project by reporting issues, submitting pull requests, or sharing your feedback with the community.

## :pushpin: Basic usage

The EITpyLab lib uses parameters file as inputs to create a <i>session</i> for your development. The files used are listed next. For a deep documentation, please access the mkdocs local version of it.
