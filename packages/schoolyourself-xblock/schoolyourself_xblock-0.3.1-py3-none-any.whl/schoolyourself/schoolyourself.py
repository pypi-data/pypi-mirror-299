    The School Yourself XBlocks (SchoolYourselfLessonXBlock and
    SchoolYourselfReviewXBlock) are very similar in that both of them
    show iframes that point to another location.

    The "Lesson" XBlock points the introduction page for one of our
    lessons and allows them to continue navigating whatever branches
    they choose to follow until they reach the "end" page for that
    lesson. These do not contribute to the grade, and the user may
    actually choose to skip it if they want to.

    The "Review" XBlock points to an adaptive assessment for a given
    lesson. This DOES participate in the course grade, and requires that
    users reach a certain mastery level before it shows a message
    telling them that they can quit. The user may quit at any point
    and resume later. Note that a user's grade may *decrease* if they
    master the topic, then come back later and get subsequent
    questions wrong.
