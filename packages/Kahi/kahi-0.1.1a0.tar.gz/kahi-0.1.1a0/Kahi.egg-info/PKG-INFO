# Kahi
KAHI is a powerful tool by offering a framework to define a workflow of sequential tasks using a plugin system that KAHI understands.

# Plugins
Take a look on plugins examples in the repository
https://github.com/colav/Kahi_plugins 

## Installation

To install KAHI, follow these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command:

```shell
pip install kahi
```
Additionally, if you require specific plugins, you can install them using the following command:
```shell
pip install plugin-name
```
Replace plugin-name with the name of the desired plugin.

If the user wants to install all available plugins run:
```shell
pip install kahi[all]
```


# Usage

To use KAHI, you need to define a YAML file that contains the workflow and global configuration variables. Here is an example of a YAML file:
```yaml
config:
  database_url: localhost:27017
  database_name: kahi
  log_database: kahi_log
  log_collection: log
workflow:
  scimago_sources:
    file_path: scimago/scimagojr 2020.csv
  doaj_sources:
    database_url: localhost:27017
    database_name: doaj
    collection_name: stage
```
In the config section, you can specify the MongoDB URL, database name, log database, and log collection for KAHI to use.

The workflow section contains the sequential tasks of the workflow. Each task is defined with a unique name and specific configuration options based on the data source. In the example above, three tasks are defined: ror_affiliations, staff_affiliations, and scienti_affiliations.
**Every task should be related to a plugin**

Finally, to run the workflow, use the following command:
```shell
kahi_run --workflow worflow.yaml
```
Replace workflow.yaml with the path to your YAML file.

Suggested workflows can be found on [our worflow repository](https://github.com/colav/impactu/tree/main/workflows).

# Logging
KAHI keeps a detailed log of each plugin's execution in a mongodb collection, including the name, execution time, elapsed time, execution status, and error messages. This information is valuable for both users and developers, and it enables the ability to resume the workflow from the last successful task.

Plugins can take advantage of a researved parameter **task**. When the reserved paramer task is used, the log entry becomes unique with the name of the plugin and the task as a suffix.

# Creating a template package

You can create a template package structure by running:
```
kahi_generate --plugin  myplugin
```
and a basic installable template called Kahi_myplugin will be created.


# Contributing
If you are interested in contributing to KAHI or creating your own plugins, please refer to the kahi-plugins repository. It contains the necessary resources and documentation to implement new plugins easily. Feel free to submit pull requests or report any issues you encounter.
