The [ImportModifyInfo](https://github.com/kergoth/beets-importmodifyinfo) Plugin for [Beets][] applies modifications to received metadata before import. This is largely intended to correct issues with imported metadata which would otherwise be lost on running `mbsync`. This plugin is inspired by the [ImportReplace][] Plugin and my old [modifyonimport][] plugin, but I found that those modifications would often be lost when running `mbsync` or equivalent. There is a limitation to the way this plugin works which is important to understand, **please** read the Limitations and Caveats section.

## Limitations and Caveats

This plugin's configuration looks like a command-line from the `modify` command. This is done for convenience, and to allow one to limit the scope of the modifications using a typical beets query. This is **not** `modify`, however, as the queries are against objects created from the importer, and modifications are made to the importer info, not the items in your library.

This means that existing metadata from the files being imported is unavailable, as is existing metadata in the database when using `import -L`. This only has access to the metadata coming from the importer, i.e. MusicBrainz.

Despite this limitation, it's valuable for correcting issues with importer metadata, or to make the imported metadata consistent.

## Installation

As the beets documentation describes in [Other plugins][], to use an external plugin like this one, there are two options for installation:

- Make sure itâ€™s in the Python path (known as `sys.path` to developers). This just means the plugin has to be installed on your system (e.g., with a setup.py script or a command like pip or easy_install). For example, `pip install beets-importmodifyinfo`.
- Set the pluginpath config variable to point to the directory containing the plugin. (See Configuring) This would require cloning or otherwise downloading this [repository](https://github.com/kergoth/beets-stylize) before adding to the pluginpath.

## Configuring

First, enable the `importmodifyinfo` plugin (see [Using Plugins][]).

To configure the plugin, make a `importmodifyinfo:` section in your configuration file. Sections may be added for `modify_albuminfo` and `modify_trackinfo`, each of which is a list of strings as you would supply to the `modify` command.

For example:

```yaml
importmodifyinfo:
  modify_albuminfo:
    - album:'some album' albumtype=ep albumtypes='ep; remix'
  modify_trackinfo:
    - album:'some album' title:'some title' title='some other title'
```

## Using

There is no direct usage other than the configuration, as these modifications are automatically applied during the import or sync process.
