wolensing
=========

``wolensing`` is a software package to simulate lensed gravitational waves. It computes the full wave optics amplification factor within the range of LIGO sensitivity and is compatible with arbitrary lens models. ``wolensing`` also supports jax to accelerate the computation.

Installation
------------

``wolensing`` can be installed with github or pip::

  pip install wolensing


Examples Notebooks
-------------------

Examples notebooks showing the computation of wave optics amplification factor for different lens models and the plots of time delay contour are available at `https://github.com/manchunyeung/wolensing <https://github.com/manchunyeung/wolensing>`_
