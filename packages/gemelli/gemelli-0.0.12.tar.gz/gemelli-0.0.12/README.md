# Gemelli

Gemelli is a tool box for running Robust Aitchison PCA (RPCA), Joint Robust Aitchison PCA (Joint-RPCA), TEMPoral TEnsor Decomposition (TEMPTED), and Compositional Tensor Factorization (CTF) on _sparse_ compositional omics datasets.

RPCA can be used on cross-sectional datasets where each subject is sampled only once. CTF can be used on repeated-measure data where each subject is sampled multiple times (e.g. longitudinal sampling). TEMPTED is specifically designed for longitundal (time series) repeated measure studies, especially when samples are irregularly sampled across subjects. Joint-RPCA allows for the exploration of multiple omics datasets with shared samples at once. All these methods are [_unsupervised_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) and aim to describe sample/subject variation and the biological features that separate them.

The preprocessing transform for both RPCA and CTF is the robust centered log-ratio transform (rlcr) which accounts for sparse data (i.e. many missing/zero values). Details on the rclr can be found [here](https://msystems.asm.org/content/4/1/e00016-19) and a interactive introduction into the transformation can be found [here](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/introduction.ipynb). In short, the rclr log transforms the observed (nonzero) values before centering. RPCA and CTF then perform a matrix or tensor factorization on only the observed values after rclr transformation, similar to [Aitchison PCA](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/70/1/57/240898?redirectedFrom=fulltext) performed on dense data. If the data also has an associated phylogeny it can be incorporated through the phylogenetic rclr, details can be found [here](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/Phylogenetic-RPCA-moving-pictures.ipynb).

# Installation

To install the most up to date version of gemelli, run the following command

    # pip (only supported for QIIME2 >= 2018.8)
    pip install gemelli

**Note**: that gemelli is not compatible with python 2, and is compatible with Python 3.4 or later. 

# Documentation

Gemelli can be run standalone or through [QIIME2](https://qiime2.org/) and as a python API or CLI. 

## Cross-sectional / multi-omics study (i.e. one sample per subject) with RPCA

If you have a [cross-sectional study design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-sectional_study) with only one sample per subject then RPCA is the appropriate method to use in gemelli. For examples of using RPCA we provide tutorials below exploring the microbiome between body sites.

Joint-RPCA allows for the exploration of those feature that seperate jointly across sample groupings and the potential interactions of those features.

## Repeated measures study (i.e. multiple sample per subject) with CTF & TEMPTED

### Tutorials

If you have a [repeated measures study design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_measures_design) with multiple samples per subject over time or space then CTF is the appropriate method to use in gemelli. For optimal results CTF requires samples for each subject in each time or space measurement. If that is not the case and your study has irregular time sampling, then TEMPTED should be used. TEMPTED also allows for the projection of new data into an existing factorization which is necessary for machine learning. For examples, explore the tutorials below.

## Performing parameter optimization and QC on results

For an introduction to these QC methods see the tutorial [here](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/RPCA-CV-QC-introduction.ipynb). Examples are also provided in the RPCA tutorials [here (RPCA QIIME2 CLI)](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/RPCA-moving-pictures.ipynb) & [here (RPCA Python API & CLI)](https://github.com/biocore/gemelli/blob/master/ipynb/tutorials/RPCA-moving-pictures-standalone-cli-and-api.ipynb). Users are encrouaged to report the QC/CV results for thier data.
