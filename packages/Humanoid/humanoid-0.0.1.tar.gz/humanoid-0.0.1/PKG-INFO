# Issues, Pull Requests, and Commits
Issues and, of course, pull requests, are tracked via GitHub.  
Accordingly, all commit messages should be prefixed with “#” (followed by an issue or pull request numbered reference).

# `googlesearch`
googlesearch is a Python library for searching Google, easily. googlesearch uses requests and BeautifulSoup4 to scrape Google.


## Usage
To get results for a search term, simply use the search function in googlesearch. For example, to get results for "Google" in Google, just run the following program:
```python
googlesearch.search("Google")
```

## Additional options
By default, `googlesearch` returns 10 results. 
To get a 100 results on Google, for example:
```python
googlesearch.search("Google", num_results=100)
```
In addition, you can change the language Google searches in.
For example, to get results in French run the following program:
```python
googlesearch.search("Google", lang="fr")
```
To extract more information, such as the description or the result URL, use an advanced search:
```python
googlesearch.search("Google", advanced=True)
```
which returns `List[SearchResult]` with each result having the properties
- title
- url
- description.

If requesting more than 100 results, googlesearch will send multiple requests to go through the pages.
To increase the time between these requests, use sleep_interval:
```python
googlesearch.search("Google", sleep_interval=5, num_results=200)
```
