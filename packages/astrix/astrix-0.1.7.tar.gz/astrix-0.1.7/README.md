## Features

Astrix comes with a set of powerful commands to help you analyze, manage, and optimize your Python projects.

- **analyze**: Analyze functions in a given Python file for various metrics like cyclomatic complexity.
  
  ```bash
  astrix analyze <filepath>

- **callgraph**: Generate a call graph of the specified Python file to visualize function dependencies.
  
  ```bash
  astrix callgraph <filepath>

- **class-info**: Analyze the specified Python file and generate a class hierarchy diagram.
  
  ```bash
  astrix class-info <filepath>

- **maintainability**: Analyze the maintainability index and Halstead metrics for the given Python file.
  
  ```bash
  astrix maintainability <filepath>

- **deps**: Analyze the specified Python file and return a list of dependencies, and return various information such as dependency name, its description, its documentation link and the github url
  
  ```bash
  astrix deps <filepath>

- **install**: Create a virtual environment for the current project and install dependencies from a specified file (e.g., requirements.txt), if the file is not provided, it simply creates a virtual environment.
