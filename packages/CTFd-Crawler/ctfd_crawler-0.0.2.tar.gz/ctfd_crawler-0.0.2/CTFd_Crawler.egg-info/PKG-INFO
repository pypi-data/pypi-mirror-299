## Features

1. Downloads
   1. Organize downloaded files into subdirectories based on challenge categories.
   2. Implement multi-threading to download multiple files simultaneously, improving overall download speed.
   3. Create a detailed log of the download process, including any errors and warnings.
   4. Show detailed progress of downloading.
2. It save description into description.txt.
3. Directory rules.

5. If contents are not in a directory, the files just saved in it.
6. All file / folder name including space is replaced with underscore.
7. There are two options in loading information about CTF.
8. Load from file (have to set directory when use crawler. if not, It basically set to current directory)
9. Load from user input (not recommended, automatically saved into file)
10. All information about ctf (name, token, url, download location) saved into file with json format for convenient access.
11. Crawling all challenges and dump them into file too.

## Usage

```python
from ctfd_crawling import CTFCrawler

crawler = CTFCrawler("./")
crawler.load("h4ckinggame") # load from h4ckinggame.json
# crawler.self_load("h4ckinggame", "https://h4ckingga.me", "****************************************************************", "archive/h4ckinggame")
print("load")
res = (crawler.get_challenges())
print("get_challenges")
crawler.download_challenges(res)
```

you can choose one option between `load` and `self_load`. `load` is loading from file and `self_load` is loading from user input.
