class PlaceholderMaster:
    """
    Static class providing placeholder protection to strings.

    There are many instances in which the result of a replacement should not be altered further
    by replacements to follow. To protect a string from further alteration,
    it is temporarily replaced by a placeholder consisting of code points in the main Unicode Private Use Area.
    Specifically, the placeholder shall be of the form `«marker»«run_characters»«marker»`,
    where «marker» is `U+F8FF`, and «run_characters» are between `U+E000` and `U+E0FF`
    each representing a Unicode byte of the string.

    The very first call to PlaceholderMaster should be to the `replace_marker_occurrences(...)` method;
    this replaces occurrences of «marker» themselves with a placeholder,
    lest those occurrences of «marker» be confounding.
    The very last call to PlaceholderMaster should be to unprotect the text
     (restoring the strings were protected with a placeholder).

    It is assumed the user will not define replacement rules
    that tamper with strings of the form `«marker»«run_characters»«marker»`.
    Note that the user should not be using Private Use Area code points in the first place,
     see <https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#C073>.
