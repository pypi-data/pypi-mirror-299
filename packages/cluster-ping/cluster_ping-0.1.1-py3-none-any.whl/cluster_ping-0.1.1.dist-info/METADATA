# Cluster_ping

This is a simple script to check if the user defined in a given kube config can ping the given cluster.
The result are currently saved to a yaml file in the operating systems temporary directory.

## Usage
### Installation
It is recommended to use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/installation/) to manage the installation.
```sh
pipx install cluster_ping
```

The cluster_ping command should then be in the path.
```sh
cluster_ping --help
```
This will list the help and prove the installation was complete.

By running the cluster_ping with the path to a kude config and the name of a cluster a yaml file is created with the results of the ping.
This file is created in the standard temporary directory for the OS.
On Linux this is `/tmp/`.
```sh
cluster_ping <Path/to/kube/confing> <Cluster Name>
```
