# Search Service Project

![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo.png "Sample inline image")

This project implements a Search Service, designed to enable efficient querying and retrieval of data from large datasets or systems, integrating with Elasticsearch for fast, scalable, and accurate search results.

This project also serves as an example for the [Python Packaging User Guide][packaging guide]'s [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing Projects][distribution tutorial].

While the focus of this project is on the Search Service and Elasticsearch integration, it does not aim to cover best practices for Python project development as a whole. For example, it does not provide guidance or tool recommendations for version control, documentation, or testing.

[The source for this project is available here][src].

The metadata for this Python project is defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, an example of which is included in this project. You should edit this file accordingly to adapt this sample project to your needs.

----
## Cleaning the Project Build Artifacts

This project includes a `Makefile` with a `clean` rule, which allows for easy removal of temporary build files, distribution files, and metadata. This helps keep the project directory clean and ensures a fresh build process.

To use the `clean` rule from the `Makefile`:

1. **Ensure `make` is installed on your system:**
   - **Linux/macOS**: Typically pre-installed.
   - **Windows**: Install via WSL or use a package manager like Chocolatey to install `make`.

2. **Navigate to your project directory**
3. **execute the following command:**

   ```bash
   make clean

This is the README file for the Search Service project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using [reStructuredText][rst] or [markdown][md use] with the appropriate [key set][md use]. It will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as the project homepage on common code-hosting services. This README should be written for that purpose.

Typical contents for this file include an overview of the project, basic usage examples, and instructions on configuring Elasticsearch integration. Generally, including the project changelog here is not recommended, but a simple “What's New” section for the most recent version may be appropriate.
