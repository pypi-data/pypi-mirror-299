# Ye Tracker

This is an unofficial Python API for interacting with the [Ye Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vW-nFbnR02F9BEnNPe5NBejHRGPt0QEGOYXLSePsC1k), a project that catalogues information about the unreleased music of rapper and producer Ye.

This project is in progress, and is seeking help for further development!
