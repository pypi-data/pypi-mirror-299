Summary: SAnTeX is a Python library which calculates seismic anisotropy from full elastic tensor of rocks from modal mineral composition, crystallographic orientation, and a crystal stiffness tensor catalogue that accounts for the dependency of elasticity with pressure and temperature. SAnTex facilitates the processing and cleaning of EBSD data and calculation of Orientation Distribution Function (ODF) and Inverse pole figure (IPF)

# SAnTex: Seismic Anisotropy from Texture

SAnTex is a Python library which calculates the full elastic tensor of rocks from modal mineral composition, crystallographic orientation, and a crystal stiffness tensor catalogue that accounts for the dependency of elasticity with pressure and temperature.

## Features

- **Pre-processing and cleaning of EBSD data**: SAnTex facilitates the processing and cleaning of EBSD data.  To enhance data completeness, SAnTex  offers the option to fill not-indexed pixels or indexed pixels removed during the cleaning process, using machine learning techniques.
- **Tensor operations**: Tensor conversions between Voigt matrix and full stiffness tensors, as well as rotations based on euler angles.
- **Material analysis**: SAnTex provides a catalogue of minerals, users can load the catalogue and can either utilise them to load stiffness tensors for their EBSD phases or make a modal rock and can calculate seismic anisotropy for the modal rock.
- **Seismic Anisotropy**: SAnTex performs calculations of seismic anisotropy at a range of pressure and temperature conditions.  It also offers visualisation capabilities, allowing users to view the calculated seismic anisotropy in 2D and 3D plots. 
- **Isotropic velocities**: Calculates isotropic seismic wave velocities (Vp, Vs and vbulk), isothermal bulk modulus, and density at elevated temperatures and pressures (Hacker & Abers, 2004).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utpal-singh/SAnTex.git
cd santex
