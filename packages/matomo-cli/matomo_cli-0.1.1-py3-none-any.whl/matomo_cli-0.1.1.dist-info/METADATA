# Readme

This is a very simple and limited cli tool for Matomo API requests.

Very limited support for anything in general. This was created as a need for a Prometheus exporter for Matomo, and we needed a base to do the calls to Matomo. Hopefully it could be used and developed together with the community.

## Environment variables

Many options could be replaced with environment variables.

| Environment Variable | Description             | Default |
| -------------------- | ----------------------  | ------- |
| MATOMO_URL           | URL to Matomo instance  | -       |
| MATOMO_TOKEN         | Access token for Matomo | -       |
| MATOMO_ID_SITE       | Site ID                 | 1       |
| MATOMO_ID_SITES      | Comma separated id's    | -       |
| MATOMO_PERIOD        | Period (day, week etc)  | day     |
| MATOMO_DATE          | today, yesterday, 2024-10-02 etc. | - |
| MATOMO_FORMAT        | json, xml or tsv.       | tsv       |

## Usage

```sh
export MATOMO_URL=https://mymatomo.instance/index.php
export MATOMO_TOKEN=DHJSHGUAGU8383

matomo api --method MultiSites.getAll --period month --date 2024-08-20 --show_columns nb_actions
```

The method you provide is the API call the tool will do (see your Matomo installation on what API:s you could use)

## Installation

```sh
pipx install git+https://github.com/Digitalist-Open-Cloud/Matomo-CLI.git
```

## Known supported API methods
