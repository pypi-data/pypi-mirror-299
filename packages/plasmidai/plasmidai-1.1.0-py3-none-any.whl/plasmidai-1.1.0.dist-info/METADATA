## Overview

Plasmid.ai provides a comprehensive set of tools and models for the analysis, design, and generation of plasmids. By utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, this project enables researchers and synthetic biologists to explore new possibilities in plasmid engineering and design.

## Installation

### Using pip

To install the Plasmid.ai package, run the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install plasmidai
```

### Using git

For development or to access the latest features, you can clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igem-toronto/plasmidai.git
cd plasmid-ai
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Plasmid.ai:

```python
import plasmidai as pai
```

## Project Structure

The Plasmid.ai project is organized into several key components:

- `data/`: Contains datasets and scripts for data processing.
  - `scripts/`: Helper scripts for data manipulation.
  - `tokenizers/`: Custom tokenizers for plasmid sequences.
- `datasets/`: Modules for loading and preprocessing plasmid datasets.
- `experimental/`: Cutting-edge features and models in development.
  - `callbacks.py`: Custom callbacks for model training.
  - `lit.py`: Lightning modules for PyTorch Lightning integration.
  - `optimizers.py`: Custom optimizers for training plasmid models.
  - `sample.py`: Functions for sampling from trained models.
  - `train.py`: Training pipelines for plasmid models.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.
- `paths.py`: Path configurations for the project.
