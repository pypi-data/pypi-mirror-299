## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use Plasmid.ai:

```python
import plasmidai as pai

# Training
python -m pai.experimental.train \
    --backend.matmul_precision=medium \
    --data.batch_size=64 --data.num_workers=4 \
    --lit.fused_add_norm=true --lit.scheduler_span=50000 --lit.top_p=0.9 \
    --trainer.accelerator=gpu  --trainer.devices=2 --trainer.precision=bf16-mixed \
    --trainer.wandb=true --trainer.wandb_dir="${REPO_ROOT}/logs" \
    --trainer.checkpoint=true --trainer.checkpoint_dir="${REPO_ROOT}/checkpoints/last.ckpt" \
    --trainer.progress_bar=true \
    --trainer.max_epochs=175

# Generation
python -m pai.experimental.sample \
    --backend.matmul_precision=medium \
    --sample.checkpoint_path="${REPO_ROOT}/checkpoints/last.ckpt" \
    --sample.precision=bfloat16 --sample.num_samples=10000 --sample.top_p=0.9 \
    --sample.wandb_dir="${REPO_ROOT}/logs"
