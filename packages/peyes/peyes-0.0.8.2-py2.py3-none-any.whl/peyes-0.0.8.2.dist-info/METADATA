# pEYES
## A Python Package for Eye-Tracking Researchers
This package is intended for scientific use when processing and analyzing eye-tracking data.  
It provides easy-to-use functions for:
- Downloading & parsing publicly available annotated eye-tracking datasets.
- Configuring eye-tracking detection algorithms, and running them on the datasets or your own data.
- Analyzing the results of the detection algorithms, and comparing them to ground truth data or to a different detection algorithm.
- Visualizing the results of the detection algorithms.

## Installation Instructions
This package has been created and tested with python ```3.12```.

To install this package as a user, use
```angular2html
pip install peyes
```
To install this package as a developer, clone the package from GitHub and run the following commands:
```angular2html
python -m venv env
git pull
pip install -e .
git checkout -b dev
```

## Usage
This package is intended for scientific use, and is designed to be easy to use for anyone with basic python knowledge.  
Most of the functions in this package are documented, and can be accessed by running:
```angular2html
import peyes
help(peyes)
```
For more detailed information, please refer to the user tutorials provided in the `docs` directory of this repository.

## Citation & License
