# pEYES
## A Python Package for Eye-Tracking Researchers
This package is intended for scientific use when processing and analyzing eye-tracking data.  
It provides easy-to-use functions for:
- Downloading & parsing publicly available annotated eye-tracking datasets.
- Configuring eye-tracking detection algorithms, and running them on the datasets or your own data.
- Analyzing the results of the detection algorithms, and comparing them to ground truth data or to a different detection algorithm.
- Visualizing the results of the detection algorithms.

## Installation Instructions
This package has been created and tested with python ```3.12```.

To install this package as a user, use
```angular2html
pip install peyes
```
To install this package as a developer, clone the package from GitHub and run the following commands:
